Bondarev, Dmitry. “Standardisation Tendencies in Kanuri and Hausa Ajami Writings.” Creating Standards: Interactions with Arabic script in 12 manuscript cultures (2019): n. pag. Web.

Although the graphic combination of the 
ḍamma
 with the letter 
wāw
 followed by the letter 
alif 
 surmounted by a 
sukūn
 sign occurs both in Hausa manuscripts and in those of the Kanuri/Kanembu area, its use, unlike in Kanembu/Kanuri, is not restricted to encoding /o/. It might be argued that this feature was borrowed from the Borno tradition, but it became more decorative than graphemic.
