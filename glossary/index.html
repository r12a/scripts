<dt id="abugida">abugida</dt>
<dd><q cite="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#abugida">A writing system in which 
            consonants are indicated by the base letters that have an inherent 
            vowel, and in which other vowels are indicated by additional 
            distinguishing marks of some kind modifying the base letter. The 
            term “abugida” is derived from the first four letters of the 
            Ethiopic script in the Semitic order: <i>alf, bet, gaml, dant</i>. (See 
            <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch06.pdf#G7382">
            Section 6.1, Writing Systems</a>.)</q></dd>
<dt id="abjad">abjad</dt>
<dd><q cite="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#abjad">A writing system in which only 
            consonants are indicated. The term “abjad” is derived from the first 
            four letters of the traditional order of the Arabic script: <i>alef, 
            beh, jeem, dal</i>. (See
            <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch06.pdf#G7382">

<dt id="alphabet">alphabet</dt>
<dd><q cite="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#alphabet">A writing system in which both consonants and vowels are 
            indicated. The term “alphabet” is derived from the first two letters 
            of the Greek script: <i>alpha, beta</i>. (See 
            <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch06.pdf#G7382">

<dt id="bccs">BCCS (base &amp; combining character sequence)</dt>
<dd>A  sequence of characters following the pattern <code>Base (Combining_mark</code><i></i> | ZWJ | ZWNJ)*. A base character that is a letter or digit, followed by zero or more combining characters, zero width joiners, and/or zero width non-joiners. This commonly reflects the minimal <a href="#typographicunit">typographic unit</a> used for operating on text.</dd>

<dt id="brahmiphoneticmatrix">brahmi phonetic matrix</dt>
<dd>It is common to arrange consonants in writing systems descended from the archaic Brahmi script in tabular form. The first 5 rows of the matrix normally represent plosives and nasals, and are ordered by place of articulation, as shown in this table.<br>

<dl>
<dt id="checked">checked</dt>
<dd><dd>A checked syllable ends in a stop sound, usually <span class="ipa">-p</span>, <span class="ipa">-t</span>, <span class="ipa">-k</span>, or <span class="ipa">-ʔ</span>. Unchecked syllables end in  sonorants <span class="ipa">m, n, ŋ, w, j</span> or vowels.</dd>

<dt id="circumgraph">circumgraph</dt>
<dd>When a single vowel-sign code point produces glyphs on more than one side of the consonant base, it is referred to as a circumgraph. For example, the following single codepoint representing a vowel-sign is rendered on both sides of the base consonant.</dd>

<dt style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/circumgraph.png" alt="କୋ" data-notes="43px Noto Sans Tai Tham"></dt>

<dt id="coda">coda (syllable)</dt>
<dd>See <a href="#syllablestructure">syllable structure</a>.</dd>

<dt id="combiningcharacter">combining character</dt>
<dd>Unicode characters such as  accents,  diacritics,  Hebrew  points, Arabic vowel signs, and Indic matras. They   normally never appear alone unless they are being described, but are combined with a preceding base character. More than one combining character may be associated with the same base character. Many combining characters appear above or below or inside the base character, however some consume space along the baseline, either before or after the base character, and are referred to as <i>spacing marks</i>, or <i>spacing combining characters</i>.</dd>

<dt id="ccs">combining character sequence (CCS)</dt>
<dd>A maximal sequence of characters following the pattern <code>Base? (Combining_mark</code><i></i> | ZWJ | ZWNJ)+. Usually a base character that is a letter or digit, followed by one or more combining characters, zero width joiners , and/or zero width non-joiners. See also <a href="#bccs">BCCS</a>.</dd>

<dt id="compositevowel">composite vowel</dt>
<dd>A composite vowel is a single vowel sound or diphthong that is represented by more than one code point from the set of vowel-signs, repurposed consonants, and diacritics available. For example, the following Tai Tham syllable <span class="ipa">kɤʔ</span> is represented using 4 vowel-signs (orange) attached to the single base consonant.</dd>

<dt style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/compositevowel.png" alt="ᨠᩮᩬᩨᩡ" data-notes="43px Noto Sans Tai Tham"></dt>

<dt id="conjunct">conjunct</dt>
<dd>In Brahmi-derived scripts it is common to find consonant clusters, ie. a sequence of consonants without intervening vowels. It is also common that the absence of intervening vowels is indicated visually by merging or changing the glyphs for the sequence in some way. This is what is referred to as a conjunct. Examples include <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hi">कक</span></span> → <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hi">क्क</span></span>, or <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="bn">কষ</span></span> → <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="bn">ক্ষ</span></span>. Conjunct behaviour is triggered in Unicode by adding a virama between the consonants.</dd>

<dt id="consonantcluster">consonant cluster</dt>
<dd>A consonant cluster is a sequence of consonants with no intervening vowels.</dd>

<dt id="contourtonelanguage">contour tone language</dt>
<dd>A contour tone language has patterns where the pitch moves up and down over the course of a syllable. Compare with <a href="#registertonelanguage">register tone language</a>.</dd>

<h2 id="d">D</h2>

<dl>
<dt id="decomposed">decomposed text</dt>
<dd>Decomposed text is usually the result of applying <a href="#nfd">Unicode normalization form D (NFD)</a>, which splits Unicode characters into component parts, typically a base character plus one or more diacritics. However, a decomposed sequence of code points may also be intentionally (or unintentionally) used by a content author where a <a href="#precomposed">precomposed</a> alternative exists. (<a href="../tutorial/part3#predecomposed">Example</a>)</dd>
<dt id="dependentvowel">dependent vowel</dt>
<dd><q cite="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#inherent_vowel">A symbol or sign that represents a vowel and that is attached or combined with another symbol, usually one that represents a consonant.</q><sup><a href="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#dependent_vowel">u</a></sup>  Dependent vowels are usually combining marks, but may also be letters (eg. in Thai, or New Tai Lue, which has no combining characters). Vowel_Dependent is one of the categories in the Indic_Syllabic_Category property set (<a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:Indic_Syllabic_Category=Vowel_Dependent:]">see a list</a>).</dd>
</dl>
</section>




<section>
<h2 id="g">G</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="grapheme">grapheme</dt>
<dd>A grapheme is a user-perceived unit of text. Graphemes generally include base characters with their combining diacritics. In some orthographies they may also include groupings of two or more base characters, with their diacritics, such as for Hindi, where the following 6 characters resolve to just 2 text units: <span lang="hi">हिन्दी  →  हि+न्दी.</span></dd>
<dt id="graphemecluster">grapheme cluster</dt>
<dd>The Unicode Standard uses generalised rules to define 'grapheme clusters', which approximate the likely grapheme boundaries in a writing system. Grapheme clusters are used as a basic unit of text for operations including forwards/backwards deletion, cursor movement &amp; selection, character counts, searching &amp; matching, text insertion, line-breaking, justification, case conversions, and sorting. The grapheme cluster definition may need to be tailored for some orthographies, such as conjuncts like <span lang="hi">न्दी </span>in Indic scripts.</dd>
</dl>
</section>




<section>
<h2 id="h">H</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="hyphenation">hyphenation</dt>
<dd>Hyphenation refers to an extra set of rules applied after the basic line-break algorithm to split words at syllable or morphological boundaries in order to improve the layout of a paragraph. Hyphenation may or may not be indicated using a visual marker at the end or start of a line, however it is commonly marked by a hyphen or other glyph.</dd>
</dl>
</section>




<section>
<h2 id="i">I</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="ijam">ijam</dt>
<dd>Arabic script diacritical marks considered to be part of a basic letter form. Unicode encodes letter+ijam combinations as separate, atomic characters, which are never given decompositions in the standard. Ijam generally take the form of one-, two-, three- or four-dot markings above or below the basic letter skeleton, although other diacritic forms occur in extensions of the Arabic script in Central and South Asia and in Africa. Compare with <a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#tashkil">tashkil</a>.</dd>

<dt id="independentvowel">independent vowel</dt>
<dd><q cite="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#independent_vowel">In Indic scripts, certain vowels are depicted using independent letter symbols that stand on their own. This is often true when a word starts with a vowel or a word consists of only a vowel.</q> Independent vowels tend to be used to represent <a href="#standalonevowel">standalone vowel sounds</a>.</dd>

<dt id="inherentvowel">inherent vowel</dt>
<dd>An inherent vowel is a vowel sound that is automatically pronounced after a consonant letter, unless specifically suppressed. <q cite="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#inherent_vowel">In writing systems based on a script in the Brahmi family of Indic scripts, a consonant letter symbol normally has an inherent vowel, unless otherwise indicated. The phonetic value of this vowel differs among the various languages written with these writing systems. An inherent vowel is overridden either by indicating another vowel with an explicit vowel sign or by using virama to create a dead consonant.</q> <sup><a href="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#inherent_vowel">u</a></sup> (<a href="../tutorial/part3#vowel-signs">Example</a>)</dd>

<dt id="invisiblestacker">invisible stacker</dt>
<dd>A character that is always invisible, and that is used between each consonant in a consonant cluster to create a stacked arrangement. <a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:InSC=Invisible_Stacker:]">Used for</a> scripts such as Myanmar, Khmer, Tai Tham, Sundanese, etc. See also <a href="#virama">virama</a>, and  <a href="#purekiller">pure killer</a>.</dd>

</section>




<section>
<h2 id="j">J</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="justification">justification</dt>
<dd>The essence of justification (unlike <a href="#letterspacing">letter-spacing</a>) is that text is arranged to fit within a given distance, usually a line width.</dd>
</dl>
</section>




<section>
<h2 id="l">L</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="letterspacing">letter spacing</dt>
<dd>Unlike <a href="#justification">justification</a>, which fits text within a fixed space, letter-spacing adds (typically regular) amounts of space between letters, and the resulting length is a by-product of that.</dd>
</dl>
</section>




<section>
<h2 id="m">M</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="materlectionis">mater lectionis</dt>
<dd>In the spelling of Arabic, Hebrew, and other Semitic languages, mater lectionis refers to a consonant that is used to indicate the location or length of a vowel. See also <a class="fnref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_lectionis">Wikipedia</a>.</dd>
<dt id="moraicsyllabary">moraic syllabary</dt>
<dd>In a moraic <a href="#syllabary">syllabary</a> long vowels and syllables with a final consonant are written with two symbols. For example, the Japanese word for Japan (<span lang="ja">日本</span>) contains 2 syllables, <i>ni-hon</i>, but 3 morae, <i>ni-ho-n</i>.  Similarly, the name of the city of Osaka has 3 syllables, <i>oo-sa-ka</i>, but 4 morae, <i>o-o-sa-ka</i>. The spelling of these words in the hiragana syllabic script has symbols for each mora, ie. <span lang="ja">にほん</span> and <span lang="ja">おおさか</span>. Morae tend to be counted as units in poetry, such as haiku, and in some languages play a role in allocation of tone.</dd>

<dl>
<dt id="normalisation">normalisation</dt>
<dd>Normalisation is the process of removing alternate representations of equivalent sequences from textual data, to convert the data into a form that can be binary-compared for equivalence.</dd>
			
<dt id="nfc">normalization form C (NFC)</dt>
<dd>See also <a href="#normalisation">normalisation</a>. <q cite="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#normalization_form_c">A normalization form that erases any canonical differences, and generally produces a <strong>composed</strong> result. For example, a + umlaut is 
converted to ä in this form. This form most closely matches legacy 
usage. The formal definition is D120 in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch03.pdf#G49537">
Section 3.11, Normalization Forms</a>.</q></dd>

<dt id="nfd">normalization form D (NFD)</dt>
<dd>See also <a href="#normalisation">normalisation</a>. <q cite="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#normalization_form_d">A normalization form that erases any canonical differences, and produces a <strong>decomposed</strong> result. For example, ä is converted to a + umlaut in this form. This form is most often used in internal processing, such as in collation. The formal definition is D118 in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch03.pdf#G49537"> Section 3.11, Normalization Forms</a>.</q></dd>

<dl>
<dt id="orthographicsyllable">orthographic syllable</dt>
<dd>This term is not clearly defined in the Unicode Standard. In the orthography notes on this site we define it to mean a typographic unit that includes more than one <a href="#syllablestructure">grapheme cluster</a>. This is commonly the case for Brahmi-derived scripts, such as Devanagari, or Balinese, when they form conjuncts or stacks.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="p">P</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="prebase">prebase</dt>
<dd>The glyph of a pre-base (or prescript) vowel sign is displayed before the consonant or orthographic syllable after which it is pronounced. If the vowel character is a combining mark, it is still typed and stored in pronunciation order, and the application will render it in the correct location. In some scripts, such as Thai, a pre-base vowel sign is a normal letter, which is typed and stored in the correct position relative to the base.</dd>

<figcaption>A prebase vowel sign, pronounced after a consonant cluster, but rendered to the left of the conjunct.</figcaption>
</figure>
</dd>

<dt id="precomposed">precomposed text/characters</dt>
<dd>A precomposed character is one that can also be broken down into separate code points representing its component parts (decomposition). Typically this will include base characters plus diacritics, such as accented Latin characters, or Indic characters with nuktas. <a href="#nfc">Normalisation Form C (NFC)</a> produces precomposed characters from many <a href="#decomposed">decomposed</a> sequences. (<a href="../tutorial/part3#predecomposed">example</a>)</dd>

<dt id="purekiller">pure killer</dt>
<dd>A character that kills the inherent vowel. It is always visible, and doesn't produce stacking or other conjunct behaviours. <a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:InSC=Pure_Killer:]">Used for</a> scripts such as Myanmar, Tibetan, Sundanese, Batak, etc. See also <a href="#virama">virama</a>, and <a href="#invisiblestacker">invisible stacker</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dt id="shaping">shaping</dt>
<dd>Making context-sensitive changes to glyph shapes. Shaping may or may not occur at the same time as context-sensitive positioning of glyphs (such as higher diacritics over tall base characters).</dd>

<dt id="spacingmark">spacing mark</dt>
<dd>Combining characters that  consume space along the baseline, either before or after the base character. (<a href="../tutorial/part3#vowel-signs">example</a>)</dd>

<dt id="standalonevowel">standalone vowel</dt>
<dd>Standalone vowels are vowel sounds that are not preceded by a consonant sound; they may appear at the beginning or in the middle of a word.</dd>

<dt id="syllabary">syllabary</dt>
<dd>A type of writing system in which each symbol typically represents both a consonant and a vowel, or in some instances more than one consonant and a vowel.</dd>

<dt id="syllablestructure">syllable structure</dt>
<dd>A model of syllable structure  divides the syllable into an <em>onset</em> followed by a <em>rhyme</em>. The rhyme is typically composed of a <em>nucleus</em> and an optional <em>coda</em>. The nucleus is the most sonorous part of the syllable. A syllable always has a nucleus, but syllables may have no onset and/or coda (eg. compare 'but', 'an', 'the', 'a').</dd>

<section>
<h2 id="t">T</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="tashkil">tashkil</dt>
<dd>Arabic script marks functioning to indicate vocalization of text, as well as other types of phonetic guides to correct pronunciation. They are separately encoded as combining marks. These include several subtypes: harakat (short vowel marks), tanwin (postnasalized or long vowel marks), shaddah (consonant gemination mark), and sukun (to mark lack of a following vowel). A basic Arabic letter plus any of these types of marks is never encoded as a separate, precomposed character, but must always be represented as a sequence of letter plus combining mark. Additional marks invented to indicate non-Arabic vowels, used in extensions of the Arabic script, are also encoded as separate combining marks. Compare with <a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/#ijam">ijam</a>.</dd>

<dt id="tone">tone</dt>
<dd>Variations in pitch used to convey lexical contrast. Tonal systems usually distinguish 2-5 levels (<a href="#registertonelanguage">register tone languages</a>), and many supplement those with combinations of tone on a given syllable (<a href="#contourtonelanguage">contour tone languages</a>). Tone mobility is also common, whereby the tone of a particular syllable can affect or create the tones of syllables alongside it.</dd>

<dt id="transliteration">transliteration</dt>
<dd>In a <em>transliteration</em> each native character is associated with an equivalent and unique Latin-script character. The transliteration may not accurately represent pronunciation, but does allow straightforward and reversible conversion between the two scripts. Compare with <a href="#transcription"><em>transcription</em></a>.</dd>

<dt id="transcription">transcription</dt>
<dd>A <em>transcription</em> is  likely to be more phonetically accurate than a <a href="#transliteration"><em>transliteration</em></a> (though usually still only reflects an approximation to the actual sound), and, in particular, does not usually allow completely reversible conversions.</dd>

<dt id="typographicunit">typographic unit</dt>
<dd>A unit of text that is not normally split during a particular text operation. The actual constituents of a typographic unit vary according to the process being applied to the text. For example, in complex scripts cursor movement may use smaller typographic units than line-breaking, for the same text. See also <a href="#bccs">BCCS</a>.</dd>

<dt id="virama">virama</dt>
<dd>From the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#virama">Unicode Standard</a>: <q>From Sanskrit. The name of a sign used in many Indic and other Brahmi-derived scripts to suppress the inherent vowel of the consonant to which it is applied, thereby generating a dead consonant. (See <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch12.pdf#G12284">Section 12.1, Devanagari</a>.) The sign varies in shape from script to script, and may be known by other names in various languages.</q> It may also be visible or hidden in consonant clusters, depending on the language and context. <a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5B%3AInSC%3DVirama%3A%5D&g=&i=">Used for</a> scripts such as Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Balinese, etc. See also  <a href="#invisiblestacker">invisible stacker</a>, and  <a href="#purekiller">pure killer</a>.
</dd>

<dt id="vocalic">vocalic</dt>
<dd>Vocalics are letters derived from Sanskrit that generally behave like vowels, but represent <span class="ipa">r</span> or <span class="ipa">l</span> followed by a vowel. They are often available both as vowel-signs and independent vowel letters.</dd>

<dt id="vowelsign">vowel sign</dt>
<dd>One or more  glyphs which taken together represent a vowel. Typically found in Brahmi-derived scripts, where a vowel sign overwrites the <a href="#inherentvowel">inherent vowel</a>. Sometimes vowel-signs have multiple parts, which may be displayed on different sides of the base consonant or cluster. Vowel signs are usually combining characters, but may sometimes be a combination of combining marks and free-standing letters (eg. Thai, Lao), or just free-standing letters (eg. New Tai Lue). Vowel signs are typically attached to the onset of an orthographic syllable, rather than to a particular consonant, even when the syllable begins with a consonant cluster.

<dd>The concept of 'word' is difficult to define in any language (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/typography/linebreak.en#whatisword">What is a word?</a>). Here, a word is an often vaguely-defined, but recognisable semantic unit that is typically smaller than a phrase and may comprise one or more syllables. Word boundaries are typically important for text operations such as line-breaking, and for prosodic and phonetic rules.</dd>
