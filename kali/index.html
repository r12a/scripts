<section>
<p>This page gathers  basic information about the Kayah Li script and its use for the Western Kayah language. It aims (generally) to provide an introduction to the orthography and typographic features, and (specifically) to advise how to write Kayah Li using Unicode.</p>
<p>Phonetic transcriptions on this page should be treated as an approximate guide, only. Many are more phonemic than phonetic, and there may be variations depending on the source of the transcription.</p>

<h2>Usage &amp; history</h2>
<p>Kayah Li is used to write the Eastern and Western Kayah Li languages, spoken by 360,000 and 210,000 people, respectively. Although native to Myanmar, these languages are now also spoken by significant numbers of refugees in Thailand, where the Kayah Li script is taught in schools.</p>

<h2>Basic features</h2>
<p>The Kayah Li script  is an <span class="termHighlight"><a class="termref" href="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#alphabet">alphabet</a></span>. Both consonants and vowels are indicated by letters.  See the table to the right for a brief overview of features  for the Western Kayah language.</p>
<p>Kayah Li text runs <mark>left to right in horizontal lines</mark>.</p>
<p>It is a fairly simple and straightforward writing system.</p>
<p>Words are <mark>separated by spaces</mark>, and  can be multi-syllabic.</p>
<p>Kayah Li has <mark>24 basic consonant letters</mark>. Two are not commonly used, and one is used for more than one sound. Otherwise, things are very phonetic.</p>
<p>There are <mark>no syllable or word final consonants</mark>, but <mark>syllable-initial clusters may include up to 4 consonants</mark>.</p>
<p>Kayah Li has a mixed approach to vowel letters. <mark>4 basic letters</mark> are written as simple characters, and <mark>5 more vowels are written using <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="kyu">&#xA922;</span> [<a href="/scripts/kali/block#charA922"><span class="uname">U+A922 KAYAH LI LETTER A</span></a>]</span></mark> and a combining character. The one common diphthong, <span class="ipa">ɯə</span>, is somewhat more complicated, however, and uses different sequences of consonant characters to write breathy and non-breathy forms. The combining vowel diacritics can also be used with <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="kyu">&#xA923;</span> [<a href="/scripts/kali/block#charA923"><span class="uname">U+A923 KAYAH LI LETTER OE</span></a>]</span> to write diphthongs used in loan words.</p>
<p><mark>Breathy vowels</mark> are indicated by preceding them with <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="kyu">&#xA91F;</span> [<a href="/scripts/kali/block#charA91F"><span class="uname">U+A91F KAYAH LI LETTER HA</span></a>]</span>. There is no nasalisation.</p>
<p>Kayah Li has <mark>3 combining tone marks</mark>, which are always used  in a straightforward way at the end of every syllable to indicate one of 4 tones. One tone is not marked.</p>
<p>Kayah Li has its <mark>own set of decimal digits</mark>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>







<!--
myanmar
<p>The 20 consonant letters used for pure Burmese words are supplemented by 9 more which are used in Sanskrit words.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant stacking</mark> is used in multi-syllabic words (mostly derived from Pali) to indicate doubled  or homorganic consonant clusters. Subjoined forms are produced using a dedicated, invisible <span class="name">virama</span> character. Conjuncts do not span word boundaries.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>4 dedicated  combining marks</mark>
for the medial. Aspirated onset consonants are common: some have dedicated letters, others are indicated with a subjoined <span class="trans">h</span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use ordinary characters with a <mark>visible mark called <span class="name">asat</span></mark> to indicate that the inherent vowel is killed. There is also one dedicated final consonant (the <mark>anusvara</mark>). </p>




 thai
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high, mid, or low class</mark> related to tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p> 
<p><mark>No conjuncts</mark> are used for consonant clusters.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters and  <mark>syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds are all written with <mark>ordinary consonant letters</mark>. It can therefore be difficult to algorithmically detect syllable boundaries.</p>




 khmer
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high or low class</mark> related to pronunciation (there is no tone). Khmer has more vowel sounds than ways to write them, so the choice of consonant class indicates different sounds for the same written vowel. Other factors may also affect the  sound, such as stress, vowel harmony, and diacritics.</p>
<p><mark>Word-internal clusters</mark> are very common at the beginning of a word, but clusters also occur medially in multisyllable words, and occasionally at the end of a word (though the 2nd consonant at the word end is usually not pronounced). Clusters are indicated by <mark>stacked consonants</mark>. Subjoined forms are created using an invisible <span class="name">coeng</span> character. Stacks do not span word boundaries.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds (typically 8 consonants and characters) use <mark>ordinary code points</mark> without an inherent vowel. Because there are no spaces or other word dividers, it is difficult to detect boundaries algorithmically. Two word-final sounds (<span class="trans">m</span> and <span class="trans">h</span>) can be produced using combining marks.</p>



newtailue
<p>Each basic consonant is one of a pair, denoting either a <mark>high or low tonal register</mark> 
for the same phonetic sound.  This is very regular – each sound is represented by 2 consonant letters. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class and tone marks.<a class="fnref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Tai_Lue_alphabet">w</a></p>
<p><mark>No conjuncts</mark> are used for consonant clusters. Although, some clusters in Tai Tham are represented as single characters in New Tai Lü, in particular high tone variants such as <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦜ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦖ</span></span> (<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="nod">ᩉᩖ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="nod">ᩉ᩠ᨾ</span></span> in Tai Tham).</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>6 dedicated letters</mark> (for 3  pairs of consonants:<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦦᦨ ᦧᦩ ᦪᦫ</span></span>. There are no medial consonant letters. </p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use <mark>7 dedicated letters</mark>, which cover all needs.</p>

 taitham
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high, mid, or low class</mark> related to tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p> 
<p>Tai Tham has <mark>stacked consonants</mark>, but these do not necessarily indicate consonant clusters. The script is unusual in that any consonant in a stack can retain its inherent vowel, or be associated with a vowel-sign. The <span class="name">sakot</span>, which produces stacks, is never visible.</p>
<p>Stacks can  <mark>span word boundaries</mark>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>2 dedicated code points</mark> for the medial <span class="trans">l</span>, and a subjoined letter for medial <span class="trans">w</span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds can be written using 
<mark>6 special diacritics</mark>, but otherwise use <mark>ordinary letters</mark>, which may or may not be subjoined depending on the context.</p>


taiviet
<p>Each consonant is associated with a <mark>high or low class</mark> to indicate tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p>
<p>There are <mark>no conjuncts</mark> or subjoined consonants.</p>
<p>The only <mark>syllable-initial cluster</mark> involves labialisation, using <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="blt">ꪫ</span> <span class="transc">w</span></span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use a subset of <mark>ordinary letters</mark>, but since there is no inherent vowel, it is still simple to detect syllable boundaries. Some syllable-final consonant sounds are built into 
<mark>vowel-consonant graphemes</mark>.</p>

 javanese




<p>The 20 consonant letters used for pure Javanese words are supplemented by 1o more which are used as <mark>honorifics</mark>, a little like capital letters, and 5 more used in Sanskrit words. <mark>Repertoire extensions</mark> for 8 non-native sounds are achieved by applying the <span class="name">rerekan</span> diacritic to  characters.</p>
<p>Consonant clusters are  represented by <mark>stacked consonants</mark> (many subjoined consonants have alternative shapes) or <mark>conjoined pairs</mark>. Occasionally, a visible <span class="name">pangkon</span> is used.</p>
<p>Stacked consonants and conjoined pairs <mark>span word boundaries</mark>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>3 dedicated combining marks</mark> for the second consonant.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds may be represented by <mark>4 dedicated combining marks.</mark> Otherwise, if nothing follows, they  are <mark>ordinary consonants followed by  a visible</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="jv">&#xA9C0;</span> [<a href="/scripts/javanese/block#charA9C0"><span class="uname">U+A9C0 JAVANESE PANGKON</span></a>]</span>.</p>


tamil
<p>There are fewer consonants than in other Indic scripts. Tamil has no aspirated consonant letters, and symbols are allocated on a phonemic basis, rather than phonetic. This means that <span lang="ta" >க</span>, for example, may be pronounced as the allophones <span class="ipa">k</span> <span class="ipa">ɡ</span> <span class="ipa">x</span> <span class="ipa">ɣ</span> or <span class="ipa">h</span>, according to where it appears relative to other sounds in a word, but its pronunciation doesn't change the word.</p>
<p>The 18 consonant letters used for pure Tamil words are supplemented by 6 more Grantha consonant signs which are used for English and Sanskrit loan words.  <mark>Repertoire extensions</mark> for 4 more non-native sounds are achieved by applying the <span class="name">āytam</span> diacritic to  characters.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant clusters</mark> are indicated using the visible <span class="name">puḷḷi</span> dot to indicate that no vowel follows a consonant. There are <mark>2 ligated forms</mark> which are exceptions from the rule: <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">க்ஷ</span> <span class="trans">k͓ʂ</span> <span class="ipa">kʃʌ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">ஶ்ரீ</span> <span class="trans">ʃ͓ɾī</span> <span class="ipa">ʃri</span></span>.</p>
<p>Word-initial clusters do not appear in Tamil. Syllable-/word-final consonants  are just written using ordinary consonants with the <span class="name">puḷḷi</span> overhead, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">தமிழ்</span> <span class="trans">tmiɻ͓</span> <span class="transc">(tamiḻ)</span> <span class="meaning">Tamil</span></span>.</p>


hindi
<p>The 33 consonant letters used for Hindi are supplemented by <mark>repertoire extensions</mark> for 8 more non-native sounds  by applying the <span class="name">nukta</span> diacritic to  characters.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant clusters</mark> at any location are normally indicated using the <span class="name">virama</span> between consonants. This results in a large number of conjunct forms expressed using <mark>half-forms</mark>,  <mark>stacked consonants</mark>, and <mark>ligated glyphs</mark>. Occasionally, a visible <span class="name">virama</span> is used.</p>
<p>As part of a cluster, <mark>RA has  special forms</mark>. When initial in an orthographic syllable it appears as a hook at the top right of the  whole syllable. When non-initial it appears as one of 2 special marks applied to the other consonants.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds may be represented by <mark>2 dedicated combining marks</mark> (anusvara &amp; visarga), but are generally <mark>ordinary consonants</mark> that are not marked by a virama. Also, the inherent vowel of a penultimate consonant in a word of 3 syllables that ends in a non-inherent vowel is usually elided, and not marked as such.</p>






lao

<p>Unlike its close relative, Thai, the Lao orthography has an <mark>no inherent vowel</mark>, but still represents vowels using <mark>18 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 2 consonants. Only vowel-signs that appear above or below the consonant are <mark>combining marks</mark>; the others are <mark>ordinary characters</mark> that are typed in the order seen. Vowels are often written differently when they appear in a closed vs. open syllable.</p>
<p>There are <b class="newterm">no independent vowels</b>, and standalone vowel sounds are written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="lo">&#x0EAD;</span> [<a href="/scripts/lao/block#char0EAD"><span class="uname">U+0EAD LAO LETTER O</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section lists <mark>27 composite vowels</mark> (made from 12 vowel-signs, and 2 consonants).  Composite vowels can involve up to 4 glyphs, and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 3 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="lo">ເກັຍະ</span> <span class="transc">ēk̯äɲ̱a</span></span>.</p>
<p class="instructions">Dashes are used to  indicate whether the character represents a vowel sound in a closed   or an open syllable.</p>




thai

<p>The  Thai orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>15 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 5 consonants/diacritics. Only vowel-signs that appear above or below the consonant are <mark>combining marks</mark>; the others are <mark>ordinary characters</mark> that are typed in the order seen.

tai tham
<p>The Northern Thai orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>18 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 3 consonants. However, unlike Thai and Lao, all vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character.  Vowels are often written differently when they appear in a closed vs. open syllable.</p>
<p>There is an <mark>incomplete set of independent vowels</mark>, and standalone vowel sounds are typically written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="nod">&#x1A4B;</span> [<a href="/scripts/taitham/block#char1A4B"><span class="uname">U+1A4B TAI THAM LETTER A</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section lists <mark>29 composite vowels</mark> (made from 9 vowel-signs, and 3 consonants/diacritics).  Composite vowels can involve up  to 5 glyphs, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="nod">ᨠᩮᩬᩨᩋᩡ</span> <span class="transc">kēɔ̄ɯ̄ʔ̯a</span></span>, which can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 4 sides. </p>
<p class="instructions">Dashes are used to indicate the location of a consonant or consonant cluster. Prescript vowel-signs have been stored before the hyphen because of the limitations of the font, but in reality all vowel-signs should occur after the consonant they modify.</p>



myanmar

<p>The Burmese orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>8 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>1 prescript</mark>), and 3 consonants/diacritics. All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. In a couple of instances an asat is used to indicate tone information, rather than attaching a tone mark.</p>
<p>There are only <b class="newterm">7 independent vowels</b>, mostly used for Pali or Sanskrit words, and standalone vowel sounds are normally written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="my">&#x1021;</span> [<a href="/scripts/myanmar/block#char1021"><span class="uname">U+1021 MYANMAR LETTER A</span></a>]</span>.</p>

Composite vowels can involve up to 3 glyphs, and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 2 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="my">ကော်</span> <span class="transc">keaˣ</span></span>.</p>
<p class="instructions">Dashes are used to  indicate whether the character represents a vowel sound in a closed   or an open syllable.</p>



shan
<p>The Shan orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>13 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>2 prescripts</mark>), and 6 consonants/diacritics. However, unlike Thai and Lao, all vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. </p>
<p>There are <mark>no independent vowels</mark>, and standalone vowel sounds are written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="shn">&#x1022;</span> [<a href="/scripts/myanmar/block#char1022"><span class="uname">U+1022 MYANMAR LETTER SHAN A</span></a>]</span>.</p>

balinese
<p>The Balinese orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>11 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>2 prescripts </mark> and <mark>3 circumgraphs</mark>, all of which can decompose into  composite vowels). All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. </p>
<p><mark>Independent vowels</mark> are used at the beginning of a word for standalone vowel sounds. Inside a word these are written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ban">&#x1B33;</span> [<a href="balinese#char1B33"><span class="uname">U+1B33 BALINESE LETTER HA</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Balinese has <mark>no composite vowels, in principle,</mark> however the 3 circumgraphs  can also be decomposed into 2 parts. Those can involve up to 2 glyphs, and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on  2 sides only, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ban">ᬓᭀ</span> <span class="transc">ko</span></span>.</p>


javanese
<p>The Javanese orthography has <mark>2  inherent vowels,</mark> and represents vowels using <mark>5 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>1 prescript</mark>). All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. It is mandatory for 2 of the consonant+vowel sequences  to be written using vocalics, rather than vowel-signs.</p>
<p><mark>Independent vowels</mark> are used  for standalone vowel sounds when there is a need to distinguish normal words from proper nouns or foreign words. The normal approach for standalone vowels is to <mark>apply vowel-signs to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="jv">&#xA9B2;</span> [<a href="/scripts/javanese/block#charA9B2"><span class="uname">U+A9B2 JAVANESE LETTER HA</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Only one <mark>composite vowel</mark> is used in modern Javanese orthography, although more exist when writing Sanskrit or Kawi in this script. There are no circumgraphs. The composite vowel used in modern Javanese involves only 2 vowel-signs, and places glyphs on either side of the base consonant(s), eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="jv">ꦏꦺꦴ</span> <span class="transc">ko</span></span>.</p>


tai viet
<p>The Tai Dam orthography has  <mark>no inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>15 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 5 consonants.  Vowel signs are a mixture of <mark>ordinary spacing characters</mark>, and <mark>combining marks</mark>.</p>
<p>There are <mark>no independent vowels</mark>, and standalone vowel sounds use a <mark>vowel-sign attached to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="blt">&#xAAAE;</span> [<a href="/scripts/taiviet/block#charAAAE"><span class="uname">U+AAAE TAI VIET LETTER LOW O</span></a>]</span> or <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="blt">&#xAAAF;</span> [<a href="/scripts/taiviet/block#charAAAF"><span class="uname">U+AAAF TAI VIET LETTER HIGH</span></a>]</span>. </p>
<p>This section lists  only <mark>6 composite vowels</mark>, made from 6 vowel signs and 3 consonants. Composite vowels can involve up  to 3 glyphs, though usually only 2, and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on 2 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="blt">ꪵꪁꪫꪥ</span> <span class="transc">ɛkwy</span></span>.</p>


new tai lue
<p>The New Tai Lü orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>17 vowel-signs</mark>  (including <mark>4 prescripts</mark>). However, unlike many other SE Asian scripts, all vowel-signs are <mark>ordinary spacing characters</mark> (no combining marks), and are stored before or after the base character, as needed.</p>
<p> <span class="ednote">??? There are no independent vowels, and standalone vowel sounds are written using  vowel-signs applied to <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="shn">&#x1022;</span> [<a href="/scripts/myanmar/block#char1022"><span class="uname">U+1022 MYANMAR LETTER SHAN A</span></a>]</span>.</span></p>
<p>This section lists   <mark>9 composite vowels</mark> (made from 8 vowel signs). Composite vowels can involve up  to 3 glyphs, and  can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 2 sides (left and right only), eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦵᦂᦲᦰ</span> <span class="transc">e͕kiʔ</span></span>.</p>

 khmer

<p>The Khmer orthography has <mark>2 inherent vowels</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>17 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>3 prescripts </mark> and    <mark>5 circumgraphs</mark>, 2 of which can decompose into  composite vowels), and 8 consonants or diacritics. All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. </p>
<p>Khmer has more vowel sounds than ways to write them. Therefore, a written vowel can have different pronunciations, depending on the class of the base consonant. (There is no tone in Khmer, so classes are specially designed for vowel selection.)  Additional factors include whether this is an unstressed vowel, vowel harmony, and whether any of the special diacritics have been used to change the sound. For an in-depth treatment of pronunciation see <a href="#refs">Huffman</a> in the sources section.</p>
<p>There is an <mark>incomplete set of independent vowels</mark>, and standalone vowel sounds are typically written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="km">&#x17A2;</span> [<a href="/scripts/khmer/block#char17A2"><span class="uname">U+17A2 KHMER LETTER QA</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section lists <mark>15 composite vowels</mark> (made from 9 vowel signs, and 8 consonants/diacritics), not counting decompositions. Composite vowels can involve up to 3 glyphs, but  only surround the base consonant(s) on 2 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">កោះ</span> <span class="transc">koh̽</span></span>.</p>
<p class="instructions">Dashes are used to  indicate whether the character represents a vowel sound in a closed   or an open syllable.</p>


tamil
<p>The Tamil orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents other vowels using <mark>11 vowel-signs</mark>, including <mark>3 prescripts</mark> and <mark>3 circumgraphs</mark>. All circumgraphs can be decomposed. All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character.</p>
<p>There are  <mark>12 independent vowels</mark>, one for each vowel sound, including the inherent vowel, and these are used to write all standalone vowel sounds.</p>
<p>The only  <mark>composite vowels</mark> are those created by decomposition of the circumgraphs, and involve 2 glyphs, one on each side of the base consonant(s).</p>


devanagari
<p>The Hindi orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents other vowels using <mark>9-11 vowel-signs</mark>, including <mark>1 prescript</mark> and no circumgraphs.  All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character.</p>
<p>There are  <mark class="newterm">10-12 independent vowels</mark>, one for each vowel sound, including the inherent vowel, and these are used to write all standalone vowel sounds.</p>
<p>There are no composite vowels.</p>
<p>Vowels may be nasalised, using the <span class="name">candrabindu</span> diacritic.</p>

<figure class="characterBox auto" data-cols="ipa,trans,transc">ꤦ␣ꤨ␣ꤩ␣ꤧ␣ꤪ</figure>

<p>This makes for a basic set of vowels as follows:</p>

</p>
</section>






<section id="tones">
<h3>Tones</h3>

<p class="observation"><span class="leadin">Observation:</span> Different sources describe Kayah tones slightly differently, and this is an attempt to synthesise them.</p>

<p>Kayah Li has four tones, although the high tone is rarely seen. Each syllable is marked for tone, unless it has the mid-high tone. They are written as follows:</p>


<table>
<tr><th>low</th><td><span class="ipa">˨</span></td><td><span class="trans">¹</span></td><td><span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="kyu">&#xA92C;</span> [<a href="/scripts/kali/block#charA92C"><span class="uname">U+A92C KAYAH LI TONE CALYA</span></a>]</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>mid</th><td><span class="ipa">˧</span></td><td><span class="trans">³</span></td><td><span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="kyu">&#xA92D;</span> [<a href="/scripts/kali/block#charA92D"><span class="uname">U+A92D KAYAH LI TONE CALYA PLOPHU</span></a>]</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>mid-high</th><td><span class="ipa">˦</span></td><td><span class="trans">-</span></td><td>not written</td></tr>
<tr><th>high</th><td><span class="ipa">˥</span></td><td><span class="trans">²</span></td><td><span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="kyu">&#xA92B;</span> [<a href="/scripts/kali/block#charA92B"><span class="uname">U+A92B KAYAH LI TONE PLOPHU</span></a>]</span></td></tr>
</table>


<p>The tone marks  all combine below the base (whereas vowel diacritics combine above). Examples:<tt>r</tt> <span class="eg" lang="kyu">ꤞꤢꤨ꤬</span>
<span class="eg" lang="kyu">ꤞꤢꤨ꤭</span>
<span class="eg" lang="kyu">ꤞꤢꤨ</span>
</p>

<p class="info">The tone mark is normally written as the last component of a syllable, ie. after the vowel.<tt>e</tt> (Some fonts will correctly display the sequence <span class="name">vowel_base+tone+vowel_diacritic</span>,  but in that case the application must be relied upon to treat both orders the same for comparisons.)</p>
</section>






<section id="vowel_encoding">
<h3>Encoding choices</h3>
<p class="instructions">Visually, two  diacritics look as it they could be composed of smaller parts. This section  gives guidance on which approach is best.</p>

<p class="info">It is possible that someone may occasionally try to use 2 characters rather than the single character which is canonical. Doing so produces text that will not match correctly encoded text for search, spell-checking, and so on, and so should be avoided. The list below shows the characters in question.</p>

<figure style="font-size: 80%;" class="characterBox auto" data-cols="" data-ipa="vj-,sʰj-,sʰw-,zj-,θsj-,θsw-,hj-">ꤠꤛ-␣ꤏꤛ-␣ꤏꤝ-␣ꤐꤛ-␣ꤞꤎꤛ-␣ꤞꤎꤝ-␣ꤟꤛ-</figure>

<p>Breathy vowels add another consonant, <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="kyu">&#xA91F;</span> [<a href="/scripts/kali/block#charA91F"><span class="uname">U+A91F KAYAH LI LETTER HA</span></a>]</span>, to these groups. It usually occurs immediately after the cluster, eg.

<span class="eg" lang="kyu" dir="ltr">ꤊꤜꤛꤢꤩ꤬ꤕꤜꤟꤢꤧ</span>
</p>
<p>But when the cluster contains <span class="ipa">j</span> in second or third position it occurs before that,<tt>h</tt> eg. <span class="eg" lang="kyu" dir="ltr">ꤢ꤬ꤕꤟꤛꤢ</span>

<span id="cursiveInline">cursive text</span>;
<span id="gsubInline">context-based shaping</span>;

<p class="instructions">You can experiment with examples using the <a href="../../pickers/newtailue/">Kayah Li character app</a>.</p>

<p>Kayah Li text is not cursive (ie. joined up like Arabic).</p>
<p>There are no pre-base vowels or circumgraphs, but combining vowel letters and (especially) tones need to be applied to each base character in an optimal way.</p>
<p>Kayah Li has no special requirements for baseline alignment between mixed scripts or in general.</p>
<p>The orthography has no case distinction, and no special transforms are needed to convert between characters.</p>

<!--section id="writing_styles">
<h3>Writing styles</h3>

<p>Urdu is normally written in a <span class="trans">nasta'liq</span> writing style. Key features include a sloping baseline for joined letters, and overall complex shaping and positioning for base letters and diacritics alike. There are also distinctive shapes for many glyphs and ligatures.</p>

<figure id="fig_baseline">
<p dir="rtl" lang="ur" class="large" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="ex">مستحق</span> &nbsp;•&nbsp; <span class="ex">شخص</span> &nbsp;•&nbsp; <span class="ex">کیفیت</span></p>
<figcaption>Sloping baselines and complex joining behaviours in Urdu nastaliq text.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is achieved in Unicode by applying the correct font – the underlying characters used are not different for nasta'liq vs. other styles.</p>

<p dir="rtl" lang="ur" class="medium" style="line-height: 2.5"> کوئی شخص محض حاکم کی مرضی پر اپنی قومیت سے محروم نہیں کیا جائے گا اور اس کو قومیت تبدیل کرنے کا حق دینے سے انکار نہ کیا جائے گا۔</p>

<section id="cursive">
<h3>Cursive text</h3>

  <p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>N'Ko is usually cursive, ie. letters in a word are joined up. </p>
<p>Fonts need to produce the appropriate joining form for a code point, according to its visual context.</p>
  <figure>
<p dir="rtl" lang="nqo" class="large"><span class="ex">ߕߟߋ߬ߓߊ߰ߓߟߐߟߐ</span></p>
<figcaption>Cursive connections in a word. Note that here is both a medial and final form of <span lang="nqo">ߐ</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
    
  <p>The cursive treatment doesn't produce significant variations of the essential part of the glyph for a character (unlike Arabic).</p>
  <p>Non-cursive fonts are sometimes used, mainly as display fonts for books and article titles. <sup><a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch19.pdf">u</a></sup></p>
</section>





<section id="gsub">
<h3>Context-based shaping</h3>

<p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>@ None of the characters require special shaping based on the visual context.</p>
<p>@ Many of the subjoined and post-fixed consonant forms have different shapes from the standard glyph for that character, for example <span class="name">na</span> <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬦ</span></span>  becomes &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">᭄ᬦ</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ In addition, many conjunct clusters combine characters with special  shapes, or subtly change parts of glyphs to join smoothly. Often the changes are significant, especially the medial consonants, ya, ra, wa and la. For example, see the sequence &lt;ba, adeg-adeg, ra, adeg-adeg, ya&gt; in <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬩ᭄ᬭ᭄ᬬᬕ᭄</span> <span class="trans">b͓r͓yg͓ (briag)</span> <span class="meaning">laughter</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ Combining vowel signs can also have different shapes depending on the context. For example, the vowel sign tedung typically ligates with the preceding consonant, eg. <span class="name">ha</span> is <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬳ</span></span>  but <span class="name">&lt;ha, tedong&gt;</span> is <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬳᬵ</span></span>  and <span class="name">subjoined ya</span> is &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp" style="font-family: 'Aksara Bali WF'!important;">᭄ᬬ</span></span>  but <span class="name">&lt;consonant, adeg-adeg, ya, tedong&gt;</span> can be rendered as &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" style="font-family: 'Aksara Bali WF'!important;" lang="tmp">᭄ᬬᬵ</span></span>.</p>

<section id="cursive_shaping">
<h4>Cursive shaping</h4>

<p>The cursive treatment  produces only minor changes to  glyph shapes in most cases. A few letters, however, exhibit noteworthy changes, especially in word final  positions. <a class="figref">fig_joining_forms</a> and <a class="figref">fig_right_joining_forms</a> show all the basic shapes in Assyrian and what their joining forms look like.

<h3>Context-based positioning</h3>

			<p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>@ Prescript vowels are visually ordered, and therefore do not need to be positioned by the font.</p>
<p>@ Vowel-signs, tones, and one consonant, on the other hand, are combining characters that need to be correctly positioned relative to the base character, and multiple marks can be combined with a single base character.</p>
<p>@ When a vowel and a final consonant sign both appear above a consonant, they are placed side by side, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬱᬫ᭄ᬧᬶᬂ</span> <span class="trans">sm͓piŋ̇̽ (samping)</span> <span class="meaning">side</span></span>.</p>

<!--section id="hyphenation">
<h4>Hyphenation/word-breaking</h4>
<p>Because of the length of Tamil words, hyphenation is useful during layout, but it isn't easy to do because of the  complexity of Tamil words.</p>
<p>Hyphenation must take place at syllable boundaries. A hyphen is added at the end of the line when a word is hyphenated.</p>
<p>Prabhakar<a class="fnref" href="https://www.academia.edu/671796/Tamil_Hyphenator_P._David_Prabhakar">p</a> proposes rules that single characters should be avoided at line start/end, especially characters with nukta at line start, and a word with 5 characters including 3 consecutive consonants can't be split. He says that due to the fact that Tamil is highly inflexional, morphological or pattern based approaches are needed, rather than simple dictionary lookup.</p>
