<section>
<p>This page gathers  basic information about the Newa (or Pracalit) script and its use for the Newar language. It aims (generally) to provide an introduction to the orthography and typographic features, and (specifically) to advise how to write Newar using Unicode.</p>
<p>Phonetic transcriptions on this page should be treated as an approximate guide, only. Many are more phonemic than phonetic, and there may be variations depending on the source of the transcription.</p>

<h2>Usage &amp; history</h2>

<p>Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics are used for a range of  Algonquin and Inuit orthographies indigenous to Canada, including Cree, Ojibwe, Inuktitut, and occasionally Blackfoot languages.</p>
<p>Inuktitut syllabics are  used in Canada by the Inuktitut-speaking Inuit of the territory of Nunavut and the Nunavik region in Quebec. The script is  used by governmental agencies and in business, education, and media.</p>
<p>In 1976, the Language Commission of the Inuit Cultural Institute made Inuktitut syllabics the co-official script for the Inuit languages, along with the Latin script and standardised both orthographies.</p>
<p><span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ike">ᖃᓂᐅᔮᖅᐸᐃᑦ</span> <span class="ipa">qaniujaːqpaˈit</span> <span class="meaning">Inuktitut syllabics</span></span>
<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ike">ᖃᓕᐅᔮᖅᐸᐃᑦ</span> <span class="ipa">qaliujaːqpait</span> <span class="meaning">something else</span></span></p>
<p>The 'Inuktitut language' comprises a number of similar dialects, which have divergeant vocabulary and pronunciation. The following lists dialects in Nunavit: Inuinnaqtun, Nattilingmiutut, Qamani’tuarmiutut, Paallirmiutut, Aivilingmiutut, North Qikiqtaaluk, Central Qikiqtaaluk, South Qikiqtaaluk (includes the capital, Iqaluit), and Sanikiluarmiutut. The orthography follows the sounds spoken, which leads to different spellings for the different dialects. Some dialects use only the Latin orthography.</p>
<p>The Canadian syllabic script was first created in 1840 by the British missionary James Evans for writing the Swampy Cree dialect. The individual symbols may represent different phonemes for each language.</p>
<p>The syllabic script was first adapted to represent Inuktitut around the middle of the 1800s, again by missionaries, and early print runs occurred in the 1870s.<span class="instructions"><a class="fnref more" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuktitut_syllabics#History">w</a></span></p>

<h3>Orthographic development &amp; variants</h3>
<p>@ Hausa has also been written in ajami since the early 17th century.<a class="fnref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_language">w</a></p>
<p>@ There is no standard system of using ajami for Hausa, and different writers may use letters with different values.<a class="fnref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_language">w</a></p>
<p>@ There are or have been a number of variant practices for writing Hausa ajami. There are also some confusable characters. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>@ There is some variation in sources about the use of <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ha" dir="rtl">&#x06CC;</span> [<a href="/scripts/arabic/block#char06CC"><span class="uname">U+06CC ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH</span></a>]</span> versus <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="xx" dir="rtl">&#x064A;</span> [<a href="/scripts/arabic/block#char064A"><span class="uname">U+064A ARABIC LETTER YEH</span></a>]</span>. Most sources seem to agree, however, that the <span class="ipa">iː</span> uses <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ha" dir="rtl">&#x0649;</span> [<a href="/scripts/arabic/block#char0649"><span class="uname">U+0649 ARABIC LETTER ALEF MAKSURA</span></a>] </span>,  whereas the end of a diphthong or the consonant <span class="ipa">j</span> uses one of the former. However, some sources show <span class="uname">YEH</span> instead of <span class="uname">FARSI YEH</span> for medial forms. They only differ in that the isolate and final forms of <span class="uname">FARSI YEH</span> have no dots, ie. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ha" dir="rtl">ییی</span></span> vs. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ha" dir="rtl">ييي</span></span>.</li>
<li>@ Unicode policy for the Arabic script is to encode fully precomposed characters rather than to use combining characters for ijam. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ha" dir="rtl">&#x06DB;</span> [<a href="/scripts/arabic/block#char06DB"><span class="uname">U+06DB ARABIC SMALL HIGH THREE DOTS</span></a>] (<span class="name">wagaf</span>)</span> to create characters such as <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ha" dir="rtl">&#x069F;</span> [<a href="/scripts/arabic/block#char069F"><span class="uname">U+069F ARABIC LETTER TAH WITH THREE DOTS ABOVE</span></a>]</span>, even though the Hausa consider the wagaf to be a modifier letter rather than part of the base character.<a class="fnref" href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18094-arabic-hausa.pdf">e</a></li>

<!--
myanmar
<p>The 20 consonant letters used for pure Burmese words are supplemented by 9 more which are used in Sanskrit words.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant stacking</mark> is used in multi-syllabic words (mostly derived from Pali) to indicate doubled  or homorganic consonant clusters. Subjoined forms are produced using a dedicated, invisible <span class="name">virama</span> character. Conjuncts do not span word boundaries.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>4 dedicated  combining marks</mark>
for the medial. Aspirated onset consonants are common: some have dedicated letters, others are indicated with a subjoined <span class="trans">h</span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use ordinary characters with a <mark>visible mark called <span class="name">asat</span></mark> to indicate that the inherent vowel is killed. There is also one dedicated final consonant (the <mark>anusvara</mark>). </p>




 thai
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high, mid, or low class</mark> related to tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p> 
<p><mark>No conjuncts</mark> are used for consonant clusters.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters and  <mark>syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds are all written with <mark>ordinary consonant letters</mark>. It can therefore be difficult to algorithmically detect syllable boundaries.</p>




 khmer
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high or low class</mark> related to pronunciation (there is no tone). Khmer has more vowel sounds than ways to write them, so the choice of consonant class indicates different sounds for the same written vowel. Other factors may also affect the  sound, such as stress, vowel harmony, and diacritics.</p>
<p><mark>Word-internal clusters</mark> are very common at the beginning of a word, but clusters also occur medially in multisyllable words, and occasionally at the end of a word (though the 2nd consonant at the word end is usually not pronounced). Clusters are indicated by <mark>stacked consonants</mark>. Subjoined forms are created using an invisible <span class="name">coeng</span> character. Stacks do not span word boundaries.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds (typically 8 consonants and characters) use <mark>ordinary code points</mark> without an inherent vowel. Because there are no spaces or other word dividers, it is difficult to detect boundaries algorithmically. Two word-final sounds (<span class="trans">m</span> and <span class="trans">h</span>) can be produced using combining marks.</p>



newtailue
<p>Each basic consonant is one of a pair, denoting either a <mark>high or low tonal register</mark> 
for the same phonetic sound.  This is very regular – each sound is represented by 2 consonant letters. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class and tone marks.<a class="fnref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Tai_Lue_alphabet">w</a></p>
<p><mark>No conjuncts</mark> are used for consonant clusters. Although, some clusters in Tai Tham are represented as single characters in New Tai Lü, in particular high tone variants such as <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦜ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦖ</span></span> (<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="nod">ᩉᩖ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="nod">ᩉ᩠ᨾ</span></span> in Tai Tham).</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>6 dedicated letters</mark> (for 3  pairs of consonants:<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦦᦨ ᦧᦩ ᦪᦫ</span></span>. There are no medial consonant letters. </p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use <mark>7 dedicated letters</mark>, which cover all needs.</p>

 taitham
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high, mid, or low class</mark> related to tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p> 
<p>Tai Tham has <mark>stacked consonants</mark>, but these do not necessarily indicate consonant clusters. The script is unusual in that any consonant in a stack can retain its inherent vowel, or be associated with a vowel-sign. The <span class="name">sakot</span>, which produces stacks, is never visible.</p>
<p>Stacks can  <mark>span word boundaries</mark>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>2 dedicated code points</mark> for the medial <span class="trans">l</span>, and a subjoined letter for medial <span class="trans">w</span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds can be written using 
<mark>6 special diacritics</mark>, but otherwise use <mark>ordinary letters</mark>, which may or may not be subjoined depending on the context.</p>


taiviet
<p>Each consonant is associated with a <mark>high or low class</mark> to indicate tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p>
<p>There are <mark>no conjuncts</mark> or subjoined consonants.</p>
<p>The only <mark>syllable-initial cluster</mark> involves labialisation, using <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="blt">ꪫ</span> <span class="transc">w</span></span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use a subset of <mark>ordinary letters</mark>, but since there is no inherent vowel, it is still simple to detect syllable boundaries. Some syllable-final consonant sounds are built into 
<mark>vowel-consonant graphemes</mark>.</p>

 javanese




<p>The 20 consonant letters used for pure Javanese words are supplemented by 1o more which are used as <mark>honorifics</mark>, a little like capital letters, and 5 more used in Sanskrit words. <mark>Repertoire extensions</mark> for 8 non-native sounds are achieved by applying the <span class="name">rerekan</span> diacritic to  characters.</p>
<p>Consonant clusters are  represented by <mark>stacked consonants</mark> (many subjoined consonants have alternative shapes) or <mark>conjoined pairs</mark>. Occasionally, a visible <span class="name">pangkon</span> is used.</p>
<p>Stacked consonants and conjoined pairs <mark>span word boundaries</mark>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>3 dedicated combining marks</mark> for the second consonant.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds may be represented by <mark>4 dedicated combining marks.</mark> Otherwise, if nothing follows, they  are <mark>ordinary consonants followed by  a visible</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="jv">&#xA9C0;</span> [<a href="/scripts/javanese/block#charA9C0"><span class="uname">U+A9C0 JAVANESE PANGKON</span></a>]</span>.</p>


tamil
<p>There are fewer consonants than in other Indic scripts. Tamil has no aspirated consonant letters, and symbols are allocated on a phonemic basis, rather than phonetic. This means that <span lang="ta" >க</span>, for example, may be pronounced as the allophones <span class="ipa">k</span> <span class="ipa">ɡ</span> <span class="ipa">x</span> <span class="ipa">ɣ</span> or <span class="ipa">h</span>, according to where it appears relative to other sounds in a word, but its pronunciation doesn't change the word.</p>
<p>The 18 consonant letters used for pure Tamil words are supplemented by 6 more Grantha consonant signs which are used for English and Sanskrit loan words.  <mark>Repertoire extensions</mark> for 4 more non-native sounds are achieved by applying the <span class="name">āytam</span> diacritic to  characters.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant clusters</mark> are indicated using the visible <span class="name">puḷḷi</span> dot to indicate that no vowel follows a consonant. There are <mark>2 ligated forms</mark> which are exceptions from the rule: <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">க்ஷ</span> <span class="trans">k͓ʂ</span> <span class="ipa">kʃʌ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">ஶ்ரீ</span> <span class="trans">ʃ͓ɾī</span> <span class="ipa">ʃri</span></span>.</p>
<p>Word-initial clusters do not appear in Tamil. Syllable-/word-final consonants  are just written using ordinary consonants with the <span class="name">puḷḷi</span> overhead, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">தமிழ்</span> <span class="trans">tmiɻ͓</span> <span class="transc">(tamiḻ)</span> <span class="meaning">Tamil</span></span>.</p>


hindi
<p>The 33 consonant letters used for Hindi are supplemented by <mark>repertoire extensions</mark> for 8 more non-native sounds  by applying the <span class="name">nukta</span> diacritic to  characters.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant clusters</mark> at any location are normally indicated using the <span class="name">virama</span> between consonants. This results in a large number of conjunct forms expressed using <mark>half-forms</mark>,  <mark>stacked consonants</mark>, and <mark>ligated glyphs</mark>. Occasionally, a visible <span class="name">virama</span> is used.</p>
<p>As part of a cluster, <mark>RA has  special forms</mark>. When initial in an orthographic syllable it appears as a hook at the top right of the  whole syllable. When non-initial it appears as one of 2 special marks applied to the other consonants.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds may be represented by <mark>2 dedicated combining marks</mark> (anusvara &amp; visarga), but are generally <mark>ordinary consonants</mark> that are not marked by a virama. Also, the inherent vowel of a penultimate consonant in a word of 3 syllables that ends in a non-inherent vowel is usually elided, and not marked as such.</p>






lao

<p>Unlike its close relative, Thai, the Lao orthography has an <mark>no inherent vowel</mark>, but still represents vowels using <mark>18 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 2 consonants. Only vowel-signs that appear above or below the consonant are <mark>combining marks</mark>; the others are <mark>ordinary characters</mark> that are typed in the order seen. Vowels are often written differently when they appear in a closed vs. open syllable.</p>
<p>There are <b class="newterm">no independent vowels</b>, and standalone vowel sounds are written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="lo">&#x0EAD;</span> [<a href="/scripts/lao/block#char0EAD"><span class="uname">U+0EAD LAO LETTER O</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section lists <mark>27 composite vowels</mark> (made from 12 vowel-signs, and 2 consonants).  Composite vowels can involve up to 4 glyphs, and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 3 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="lo">ເກັຍະ</span> <span class="transc">ēk̯äɲ̱a</span></span>.</p>

tai tham
<p>The Northern Thai orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>18 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 3 consonants. However, unlike Thai and Lao, all vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character.

<p class="instructions">Dashes are used to indicate the location of a consonant or consonant cluster. Prescript vowel-signs have been stored before the hyphen because of the limitations of the font, but in reality all vowel-signs should occur after the consonant they modify.</p>

shan
<p>The Shan orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>13 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>2 prescripts</mark>), and 6 consonants/diacritics. However, unlike Thai and Lao, all vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. </p>
<p>There are <mark>no independent vowels</mark>, and standalone vowel sounds are written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="shn">&#x1022;</span> [<a href="/scripts/myanmar/block#char1022"><span class="uname">U+1022 MYANMAR LETTER SHAN A</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section lists  <mark>18 composite vowels</mark> (made from 9 vowel signs, and 4 consonants/diacritics). Composite vowels can involve up  to 4 glyphs, which can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 3 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="shn">ၵိူဝ်</span> <span class="transc">kiūwˣ</span></span>.</p>



balinese
<p>The Balinese orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>11 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>2 prescripts </mark> and <mark>3 circumgraphs</mark>, all of which can decompose into  composite vowels). All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. </p>
<p><mark>Independent vowels</mark> are used at the beginning of a word for standalone vowel sounds. Inside a word these are written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ban">&#x1B33;</span> [<a href="balinese#char1B33"><span class="uname">U+1B33 BALINESE LETTER HA</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Balinese has <mark>no composite vowels, in principle,</mark> however the 3 circumgraphs  can also be decomposed into 2 parts. Those can involve up to 2 glyphs, and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on  2 sides only, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ban">ᬓᭀ</span> <span class="transc">ko</span></span>.</p>


javanese
<p>The Javanese orthography has <mark>2  inherent vowels,</mark> and represents vowels using <mark>5 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>1 prescript</mark>). All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. It is mandatory for 2 of the consonant+vowel sequences  to be written using vocalics, rather than vowel-signs.</p>
<p><mark>Independent vowels</mark> are used  for standalone vowel sounds when there is a need to distinguish normal words from proper nouns or foreign words. The normal approach for standalone vowels is to <mark>apply vowel-signs to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="jv">&#xA9B2;</span> [<a href="/scripts/javanese/block#charA9B2"><span class="uname">U+A9B2 JAVANESE LETTER HA</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Only one <mark>composite vowel</mark> is used in modern Javanese orthography, although more exist when writing Sanskrit or Kawi in this script. There are no circumgraphs. The composite vowel used in modern Javanese involves only 2 vowel-signs, and places glyphs on either side of the base consonant(s), eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="jv">ꦏꦺꦴ</span> <span class="transc">ko</span></span>.</p>


tai viet
<p>The Tai Dam orthography has  <mark>no inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>15 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 5 consonants.  Vowel signs are a mixture of <mark>ordinary spacing characters</mark>, and <mark>combining marks</mark>.</p>

new tai lue
<p>The New Tai Lü orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>17 vowel-signs</mark>  (including <mark>4 prescripts</mark>). However, unlike many other SE Asian scripts, all vowel-signs are <mark>ordinary spacing characters</mark> (no combining marks), and are stored before or after the base character, as needed.</p>

 khmer

<p>The Khmer orthography has <mark>2 inherent vowels</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>17 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>3 prescripts </mark> and    <mark>5 circumgraphs</mark>, 2 of which can decompose into  composite vowels), and 8 consonants or diacritics. All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. </p>
<p>Khmer has more vowel sounds than ways to write them. Therefore, a written vowel can have different pronunciations, depending on the class of the base consonant. (There is no tone in Khmer, so classes are specially designed for vowel selection.)  Additional factors include whether this is an unstressed vowel, vowel harmony, and whether any of the special diacritics have been used to change the sound. For an in-depth treatment of pronunciation see <a href="#refs">Huffman</a> in the sources section.</p>
<p>There is an <mark>incomplete set of independent vowels</mark>, and standalone vowel sounds are typically written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="km">&#x17A2;</span> [<a href="/scripts/khmer/block#char17A2"><span class="uname">U+17A2 KHMER LETTER QA</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section lists <mark>15 composite vowels</mark> (made from 9 vowel signs, and 8 consonants/diacritics), not counting decompositions.

<p>The Tamil orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents other vowels using <mark>11 vowel-signs</mark>, including <mark>3 prescripts</mark> and <mark>3 circumgraphs</mark>. All circumgraphs can be decomposed. All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character.</p>
<p>There are  <mark>12 independent vowels</mark>, one for each vowel sound, including the inherent vowel, and these are used to write all standalone vowel sounds.</p>
<p>The only  <mark>composite vowels</mark> are those created by decomposition of the circumgraphs, and involve 2 glyphs, one on each side of the base consonant(s).</p>


devanagari
<p>The Hindi orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents other vowels using <mark>9-11 vowel-signs</mark>, including <mark>1 prescript</mark> and no circumgraphs.  All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character.</p>
<p>There are  <mark class="newterm">10-12 independent vowels</mark>, one for each vowel sound, including the inherent vowel, and these are used to write all standalone vowel sounds.</p>

<h3>Vowel-signs</h3>
<p id="def-vowelsign" class="explanatoryintro definitionStub"></p>

<p>Non-inherent  vowel sounds that follow a consonant  are represented using <span class="name">vowel-signs</span>, eg. <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="new">&#x1140E;&#x11437;</span> [<a href="/scripts/newa/block#char1140E"><span class="uname">U+1140E NEWA LETTER KA</span></a> + <a href="/scripts/newa/block#char11437"><span class="uname">U+11437 NEWA VOWEL SIGN II</span></a>]</span> is pronounced <span class="ipa">kiː</span>. Newar uses the following vowel-signs. They may be used on their own, or in combination with other characters (see <a class="secref">composite_vowels</a>).</p>

<p>Newar vowel-signs are all combining characters.  All vowel-signs are  stored after the base consonant, and the font puts them in the correct place for display. This also applies for the 5 <a href="#circumgraphs">circumgraphs</a>, where a single code point produces glyphs on more than one side of the consonant base.</p>
<p>Five vowel-signs are <em>spacing</em> marks, meaning that they consume horizontal space when added to a base consonant.</p>

<p>A rather unusual feature of Newa orthography is that vowel-signs with a wavy horizontal line replace the flat headstroke of the base consonant.</p>

<h3>Circumgraphs</h3>
<p id="def-circumgraph" class="explanatoryintro definitionStub"></p>

<p>Another idiosyncracy of Newa orthography is that 5 vowel-signs change shape  when attached to  the  base consonants that don't have a headstroke. Four of those vowel-signs are so-called 'wavy-headed',, and when combined with the 7 headless consonants they are rendered as circumgraphs.<tt>p,6</tt></p>
<p>The following table shows the various forms, combined with both <span class="uname">KA</span> (has headstroke) and <span class="uname">GA</span> (headless). The last 4 vowel-signs combined with the headless <span class="uname">GA</span> produce the circumgraphs.</p>

<p>No special encoding is needed to create these circumgraph forms. The shape change should be effected automatically by the font. Also, unlike some other Indic scripts, it is not possible to compose these circumgraph forms by combining other Newa characters, since the shapes don't exist in the character set. This makes life a little easier.</p>

<p>This character is also used between 2 consonants to create a conjunct (see <a class="secref">clusters</a>), in which case it is not visible.</p>
<p>@ The <span class="name">adeg adeg</span> is visible at the end of a word that ends in consonant, but is usually hidden (with occasional exceptions) when the consonant is part of a consonant cluster (see <a class="sectionref">clusters</a>).</p>

<section id="vowel_encoding">
<h3>Encoding choices</h3>
<p class="instructions">Visually, several of the standalone vowels and some vowel-signs look as it they could be composed of smaller parts. This section  gives guidance on which approach is best.</p>

<p class="info">Newa is relatively resistant to incorrect coding techniques, but it is possible that someone may occasionally try to use 2 characters rather than the single character which is canonical. Doing so produces text that will not match correctly encoded text for search, spell-checking, and so on, and so should be avoided. The list below shows some examples.</p>

<h3>Vowel sounds mapped to characters</h3>
<p>The following tables show how the above  vowel sounds commonly map to  characters or sequences of characters in the Balinese language. Sounds are split according to whether they appear in open (<mark>o</mark>) or closed (<mark>c</mark>) syllables, or as a standalone vowel (<mark>s</mark>).</p>
<p>For some diphthongs ending in <span class="ipa">-j</span> or <span class="ipa">-w</span>, Owen indicates that phonetic sequences exist. but offers no examples. Based on other examples, it is assumed here that <span class="ipa">-j</span> is formed using sakot+ya, and <span class="ipa">-w</span> using sakot+wa, except where the preceding vowel-sign extends below the baseline (such as for <span class="ipa">uj</span>).</p>

<h3>Contextual shaping</h3>

<section id="highclass">
<h4>Headstrokes &amp; headless consonants</h4>

<p>The following 7 consonant letters have no headstroke. This leads to some special shaping for 5 vowel-signs, including 4 that are changed into circumgraphs. See <a class="secref">circumgraphs</a> for details.</p>

<section id="clusters">
<h3>Consonant clusters</h3>
<p id="def-consonantcluster" class="explanatoryintro definitionStub"></p>
<p id="def-conjunct" class="explanatoryintro definitionStub"></p>

<p>@ The absence of a vowel sound between two or more consonants is visually indicated in one of the following ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stacked consonants, where the non-initial consonant appears below the initial, often with a different shape from normal.</li>
<li>Conjoined consonants, where consonants sit side-by-side but the non-initial consonant has a slightly different form that usual.</li>
<li>A visible <span class="name">adeg adeg</span> character following the initial consonant.</li>
<li>A syllable-final consonant diacritic followed by a regular consonant.</li>
</ol>
<p>@ In Unicode, the stacking and conjoining behaviour is achieved by adding <span class="codepoint"><span lang="tmp">&#x1B44;</span> <a href="/scripts/newa/block#char1B44">[<span class="uname">U+1B44 BALINESE ADEG ADEG​</span>]</a></span>  between the consonants. The font hides the glyph automatically.</p><p>@ Because there are no spaces between words, consonants at the end of one word and the beginning of the next also behave like other consonant clusters. When this leads to stacks or conjoined sequences, the joined words are not typically split at line ends.</p>


<section id="stacking">
<h4>Stacking</h4>
<p>@ To represent consonants without intervening vowels, the non-initial consonant is typically drawn below the initial consonant, and with a slightly different shape. </p>
<p>@ The following table shows 28 consonants in their normal and subjoined forms.</p>

<figure class="auto bicameral" data-cols="ipa,trans,transc">ᬓ᭄ᬓ␣ᬔ᭄ᬔ␣ᬕ᭄ᬕ␣ᬖ᭄ᬖ␣ᬗ᭄ᬗ␣ᬘ᭄ᬘ␣ᬙ᭄ᬙ␣ᬚ᭄ᬚ␣ᬜ᭄ᬜ␣ᬝ᭄ᬝ␣ᬞ᭄ᬞ␣ᬟ᭄ᬟ␣ᬠ᭄ᬠ␣ᬡ᭄ᬡ␣ᬢ᭄ᬢ␣ᬣ᭄ᬣ␣ᬤ᭄ᬤ␣ᬥ᭄ᬥ␣ᬦ᭄ᬦ␣ᬩ᭄ᬩ␣ᬪ᭄ᬪ␣ᬫ᭄ᬫ␣ᬬ᭄ᬬ␣ᬭ᭄ᬭ␣ᬮ᭄ᬮ␣ᬯ᭄ᬯ␣ᬰ᭄ᬰ␣ᬳ᭄ᬳ</figure>

<p>@ Many of the subjoined forms are just slightly smaller versions of the original, but several have very different shapes altogether, most of which ligate with the cluster initial consonant by joining strokes.</p>
<p>@ There can be up to 3 consonants combined in this way, and the third consonant must be one of <span class="name">ya</span>, <span class="name">ra</span>, <span class="name">la</span> or <span class="name">wa</span>.</p>
</section>




<section id="conjoined">
<h4>Conjoined consonants</h4>
<p>@ Some consonants in non-initial positions in a cluster remain side by side, but the non-initial consonant uses a special conjoined form, eg.  the <span class="trans">s</span>, which is normally shaped <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬱ</span>, loses some ink to its left side</span> in <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬅᬓ᭄ᬱᬭ</span> <span class="trans">ạk͓ṡ̂r (akśara)</span> <span class="meaning">alphabet</span></span>, which is characteristic of all these conjoined forms.</p>

<figure class="auto bicameral" data-cols="ipa,trans,transc">ᬓ᭄ᬲ␣ᬓ᭄ᬱ␣ᬓ᭄ᬋ␣ᬓ᭄ᬌ␣ᬓ᭄ᬨ␣ᬓ᭄ᬧ␣ᬓ᭄ᬧ᬴␣ᬓ᭄ᭈ␣ᬓ᭄ᭊ</figure>

<p>@ The conjoined form of <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="tmp">&#x1B32;</span> [<a href="newa#char1B32"><span class="uname">U+1B32 BALINESE LETTER SA</span></a>]</span> is unusual in that it involves strokes both below and to the right of the initial consonant, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬧᬓ᭄ᬲ</span> <span class="trans">pk͓s (paksa)</span> <span class="meaning">force</span></span>.</p>
</section>



<section id="adegadeg">
<h4>Visible <span class="name">adeg adeg</span></h4>
			<p>@ Because there is no word separator, consonants at the end of one word and beginning of the following word are normally stacked, too. </p>
<p>@ In some cases this leads to ambiguity about whether this is one or two words. If you really want to make clear which is which, you can use an explicit <span class="name">adeg-adeg</span>, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬧᬓ᭄ᬭᬫᬦ᭄</span> <span class="trans">pk͓rmn͓ (pakraman)</span> <span class="meaning">membership</span></span>  vs.  <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬧᬓ᭄‌ᬭᬫᬦ᭄</span> <span class="trans">pk͓ₓrmn͓ (Pak Raman)</span> <span class="meaning">Mr Raman</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ You  do this in Unicode by including <span class="codepoint"><span lang="tmp">&#x200C;</span> <a href="/scripts/punctuation/block#char200C">[<span class="uname">U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER</span>]</a></span> after the <span class="name">adeg-adeg</span>.</p>
            
	<p>@ A somewhat ambiguous situation arises where  apparently norms prevent certain combinations stacking. For example, the name of the village <span class="trans">tamblung</span> should not stack the <span class="trans">mbl</span>, but should look like <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬢᬫ᭄‌ᬩ᭄ᬮᬂ</span></span> . The Unicode Standard advises to use a zero-width non-joiner after <span class="name">ma</span>, to achieve this.</p>
<p>@ Note that this may also be achieved by intelligence in the font, as was actually the case when I generated this example (click on it to see). It's not clear to me what is the preferred approach: put ZWNJ in only when the font doesn't do what you want, or use it always. The latter may lead to more consistent content where different fonts are applied to the text (eg. after cut and paste). In theory, this shouldn't affect searching and sorting, although some applications may not 
            ignore the ZWNJ as they should.</p>
</section>





<section id="initialclusters">
<h4>syllable-initial consonant clusters</h4>
<p>@ The  consonants  <span class="name">ya</span>, <span class="name">ra</span>, <span class="name">la</span> and <span class="name">wa</span> regularly appear immediately after the initial consonant in a syllable. Newa has no special characters for these medial sounds, they are just written using the normal approach for dealing with consonant clusters, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬓ᭄ᬭᬫ</span> <span class="trans">k͓rm (krama)</span> <span class="meaning">member</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ Multiple medials can occur:  <span class="trans">r</span> or <span class="trans">l</span> can be followed by <span class="trans">w</span> or <span class="trans">y</span>, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬩ᭄ᬭ᭄ᬬᬕ᭄</span> <span class="trans">b͓r͓yg͓ (bryag)</span> <span class="meaning">laughter</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ In addition, the vocalics can produce consonant sounds in medial position, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp"> ᬓᬺᬰ᭄ᬡ</span> <span class="trans">kr̥ŝ͓n̂ (Krĕsna)</span> <span class="meaning">Krishna</span></span>.</p>
<p>@  See <a class="sectionref">clusters</a> for more details on shaping of glyphs.</p>
</section>





<section id="wordclusters">
<h4>Syllable-final diacritics</h4>

<p>@ The expected typing and storage position for tone marks is immediately after the base consonant of the syllable, or after a superscript vowel-sign if there is one.

According to some, most dialects of Lao and Isan have six tones, those of Luang Prabang have five. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_language">wl</a></sup> See the section <a class="sectionref">tonevalues</a> for more detailed discussion of tones.</p>

<h2>Glyph shaping &amp; positioning</h2>

<p class="instructions">This section brings together information about the following topics:
<span id="writingstylesInline">writing styles</span>; 
<span id="cursiveInline">cursive text</span>;
<span id="gsubInline">context-based shaping</span>;
<span id="gposInline">context-based positioning</span>;
<span id="baselinesInline">baselines, line height, etc.</span>;
<span id="fontstyleInline">font styles</span>;
<span id="transformsInline">case &amp; other character transforms</span>.
</p>

<p class="instructions">You can experiment with examples using the <a href="../../pickers/newtailue/">Newa character app</a>.</p>

<p>Newa text is not cursive (ie. joined up like Arabic), however there is a significant amount of interaction between glyphs, and some joining, around consonant clusters.</p>
<p>Prescript vowels are visually ordered, and since there are no combining characters and no joining behaviour, the Newa script has no contextual variation or placement of glyphs. Nor is printed text cursive.</p>
<p>Newa has no special requirements for baseline alignment between mixed scripts or in general.</p>
<p>The orthography has no case distinction, and no special transforms are needed to convert between characters.</p>

<!--section id="writing_styles">
<h3>Writing styles</h3>

<p>Urdu is normally written in a <span class="trans">nasta'liq</span> writing style. Key features include a sloping baseline for joined letters, and overall complex shaping and positioning for base letters and diacritics alike. There are also distinctive shapes for many glyphs and ligatures.</p>

<figure id="fig_baseline">
<p dir="rtl" lang="ur" class="large" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="ex">مستحق</span> &nbsp;•&nbsp; <span class="ex">شخص</span> &nbsp;•&nbsp; <span class="ex">کیفیت</span></p>
<figcaption>Sloping baselines and complex joining behaviours in Urdu nastaliq text.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is achieved in Unicode by applying the correct font – the underlying characters used are not different for nasta'liq vs. other styles.</p>

<p dir="rtl" lang="ur" class="medium" style="line-height: 2.5"> کوئی شخص محض حاکم کی مرضی پر اپنی قومیت سے محروم نہیں کیا جائے گا اور اس کو قومیت تبدیل کرنے کا حق دینے سے انکار نہ کیا جائے گا۔</p>

<section id="cursive">
<h3>Cursive text</h3>

  <p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>N'Ko is usually cursive, ie. letters in a word are joined up. </p>
<p>Fonts need to produce the appropriate joining form for a code point, according to its visual context.</p>
  <figure>
<p dir="rtl" lang="nqo" class="large"><span class="ex">ߕߟߋ߬ߓߊ߰ߓߟߐߟߐ</span></p>
<figcaption>Cursive connections in a word. Note that here is both a medial and final form of <span lang="nqo">ߐ</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
    
  <p>The cursive treatment doesn't produce significant variations of the essential part of the glyph for a character (unlike Arabic).</p>
  <p>Non-cursive fonts are sometimes used, mainly as display fonts for books and article titles. <sup><a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch19.pdf">u</a></sup></p>
</section>





<section id="gsub">
<h3>Context-based shaping</h3>

<p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>@ None of the characters require special shaping based on the visual context.</p>
<p>@ Many of the subjoined and post-fixed consonant forms have different shapes from the standard glyph for that character, for example <span class="name">na</span> <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬦ</span></span>  becomes &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">᭄ᬦ</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ In addition, many conjunct clusters combine characters with special  shapes, or subtly change parts of glyphs to join smoothly. Often the changes are significant, especially the medial consonants, ya, ra, wa and la. For example, see the sequence &lt;ba, adeg-adeg, ra, adeg-adeg, ya&gt; in <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬩ᭄ᬭ᭄ᬬᬕ᭄</span> <span class="trans">b͓r͓yg͓ (briag)</span> <span class="meaning">laughter</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ Combining vowel signs can also have different shapes depending on the context. For example, the vowel sign tedung typically ligates with the preceding consonant, eg. <span class="name">ha</span> is <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬳ</span></span>  but <span class="name">&lt;ha, tedong&gt;</span> is <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬳᬵ</span></span>  and <span class="name">subjoined ya</span> is &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp" style="font-family: 'Aksara Bali WF'!important;">᭄ᬬ</span></span>  but <span class="name">&lt;consonant, adeg-adeg, ya, tedong&gt;</span> can be rendered as &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" style="font-family: 'Aksara Bali WF'!important;" lang="tmp">᭄ᬬᬵ</span></span>.</p>

<section id="cursive_shaping">
<h4>Cursive shaping</h4>

<p>The cursive treatment  produces only minor changes to  glyph shapes in most cases. A few letters, however, exhibit noteworthy changes, especially in word final  positions. <a class="figref">fig_joining_forms</a> and <a class="figref">fig_right_joining_forms</a> show all the basic shapes in Assyrian and what their joining forms look like.

<h3>Context-based positioning</h3>

			<p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>@ Prescript vowels are visually ordered, and therefore do not need to be positioned by the font.</p>
<p>@ Vowel-signs, tones, and one consonant, on the other hand, are combining characters that need to be correctly positioned relative to the base character, and multiple marks can be combined with a single base character.</p>
<p>@ When a vowel and a final consonant sign both appear above a consonant, they are placed side by side, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬱᬫ᭄ᬧᬶᬂ</span> <span class="trans">sm͓piŋ̇̽ (samping)</span> <span class="meaning">side</span></span>.</p>

<h3>Word boundaries</h3>
<p id="def-wordboundary" class="explanatoryintro definitionStub"></p>

<p class="prompts">tbd</p>


<p>@ Words are not separated by spaces, and in fact some word boundaries occur between stacked consonants. This means that segmentation for line-breaking, etc. uses orthographic syllables as a unit, where orthographic means </p>

<p>@ Words are not separated by spaces, nontheless double-clicking or other selection methods are expected to identify word boundaries. There are 2 alternative approaches for managing this.</p>
<ol>
<li>An application  uses a dictionary or smart algorithm to parse the text and determine word boundaries.</li>
<li>The author uses <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><a href="/scripts/punctuation/block#char200B"><span class="uname">U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE</span></a></span> between words when creating the content.</li>
</ol>
<p>@ Unlike Thai or Khmer, it is fairly straightforward to parse individual syllables in Lao, because its alphabetic nature makes it possible to identify syllable-final consonants. Note that syllable-based segmentation must identify and keep together any syllable-initial clusters involving <span class="trans">h</span> or <span class="trans">l</span>, for example, the initial 2 letters in<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="lo">ຫມາ</span> <span class="trans">hm̱ā (mā)</span> <span class="meaning">dog</span></span> should wrap as a unit just like the ligated form,<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="lo">ໝາ</span> <span class="trans">mā</span></span>.</p>
<p class="ednote">What about kw etc?</p>
<p>While nearly all syllables can be argued to be words in their own right, there is still a preference for keeping  multi-syllabic words together (eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="lo">ປະເທດ</span> <span class="trans">p̯aēṯʰd̯ (pa thēt)</span> <span class="meaning">country</span></span>)  during word-based segmentation. For this, an application  needs to use a dictionary to parse Lao text.</p>
<p>@ However, widely used software automatically inserts <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="km">&#x200B;</span> [<a href="/scripts/khmer/block#char200B"><span class="uname">U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE</span></a>]</span> (ZWSP) in Lao text at word or syllable boundaries, and many web pages use such inserted ZWSP characters to get browsers to wrap correctly.<a class="fnref" href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues/3#issuecomment-385847864">g</a></p>
<p>@ If a dictionary fails to keep two or more syllables together as needed, it should be possible to use the Unicode character <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><a href="/scripts/punctuation/block#char2060">	<span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER </span></a></span>between the two syllables. This is an invisible character, equivalent to a zero-width no-break space, and used to prevent line-breaks.</p>
<p>@ If dictionaries are used for segmentation, they should be selected based on the language, not the script. (See the <a href="#languages">list of languages</a> using the Lao script.)</p>


<p>@ Devanagari has hyphenated words – mainly conjoined nouns, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hi">लाभ-हानि</span> <span class="trans">lābʰ-hāni</span> <span class="meaning">profit-loss</span></span>, and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hi">माता-पिता</span> <span class="trans">mātā-pitā</span> <span class="meaning">parents</span></span>. <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ilreq/">i</a></sup></p>

<h3>Line breaking &amp; hyphenation</h3>
    <p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>@  Lines are mostly broken at  inter-word spaces. As in almost all writing systems, certain punctuation characters should not appear at the end or the start of a line.</p>
<p>@  Common practice is to break the sentence at any point when it reaches the end of a line, except that no line breaks should be allowed within syllable boundaries and no line breaks are allowed just before a colon, comma or full stop.</p>
<p>@ Although Lao doesn't use spaces or dividers between words, the expectation is that line-breaks occur at word boundaries. See <a class="secref">word</a> for a discussion of issues related to word-based segmentation.</p>
<p>@ In lontar texts where a word must be broken at the end of a line (always after a full syllable), the sign <span class="codepoint"><span lang="tmp">&#x1B60;</span> <a href="/scripts/newa/block#char1B60">[<span class="uname">U+1B60 BALINESE PAMENENG</span>]</a></span>  is inserted. This sign is not used as a word-joining hyphen; it is used only in linebreaking.</p>
<p>@ For an application to use this correctly, it would need to know where the word boundaries are in the text, and then put this character at the end of the line only when a multisyllabic word is broken. This would require a dictionary to be applied to the text, as it is for line-breaking in Thai or Khmer, even though breaking on syllables is the default.</p>
<p>@ Like most writing systems, certain characters are expected not to start or end a line. For example, periods and commas shouldn't start a line, and opening parentheses shouldn't end a line.</p>



<section id="hyphenation">
<h4>Hyphenation/word-breaking</h4>
<p>Because of the length of Tamil words, hyphenation is useful during layout, but it isn't easy to do because of the  complexity of Tamil words.</p>
<p>Hyphenation must take place at syllable boundaries. A hyphen is added at the end of the line when a word is hyphenated.</p>
<p>Prabhakar<a class="fnref" href="https://www.academia.edu/671796/Tamil_Hyphenator_P._David_Prabhakar">p</a> proposes rules that single characters should be avoided at line start/end, especially characters with nukta at line start, and a word with 5 characters including 3 consecutive consonants can't be split. He says that due to the fact that Tamil is highly inflexional, morphological or pattern based approaches are needed, rather than simple dictionary lookup.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-39.html#NU">NU (number)</a> behaves like ordinary characters (AL) in the context of most characters but activate the prefix and postfix behavior of prefix and postfix characters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-39.html#OP">OP (open punctuation)</a> 	should be kept with the character that follows. This is desirable, even if there are intervening space characters, as it prevents the appearance of a bare opening punctuation mark at the end of a line.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-39.html#OP">PO (postfix numeric)</a> usually follows a numerical expression and may not be separated from preceding numeric characters or preceding closing characters, even if one or more space characters intervene. For example, there is no break opportunity in “(12.00) %”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-39.html#PR">PR (numeric prefix)</a>  may not be separated from following numeric characters or following opening characters, even if a space character intervenes. For example, there is no break opportunity in “฿ (100.00)”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-39.html#SA">QU (quotation)</a> characters can be opening or closing, or even both, depending on usage. The default is to treat them as both opening and closing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-39.html#SA">SA (Southeast Asian)</a> require morphological analysis to determine break opportunities, in a way similar to a hyphenation algorithm. No break opportunities will be found otherwise. Complex context analysis, often involving dictionary lookup of some form, is required to determine non-emergency line breaks. If such analysis is not available, it is recommended to treat them as AL.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-39.html#SA">SY (symbols allowing break after)</a> provides a break opportunity after, except in front of digits, so as to not break “1/2” or “06/07/99”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-39.html#SA">ZW (ZERO WIDTH SPACE, ZWSP)</a> enables  invisible break opportunities wherever <span class="uname">SPACE</span> cannot be used. It  has no width, and is treated as if it wasn't there during justification.</p>

<h2>Historical information</h2>


<section id="variants">
<h3>Orthographic development &amp; variants</h3>
<p>In 2019 the design of Adlam letter glyphs was overhauled in a
proposal to the Unicode Consortium, which resulted in changes to the
code chart. <a class="fnref more" href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19119r-adlam-font-repl.pdf">p</a></p>
<figure id="variant_shapes">
<p><img src="images/adlam_block_2018.png" alt="Adlam 2018"><img src="images/adlam_block_2019.png" alt="Adlam 2019"><img id="notoShapes" src="images/adlam_block_font.png" style="display: none;height:694px" alt="Noto Sans Adlam"></p>
<figcaption>Glyphs in the Unicode Adlam code chart showing pre-2019
(left) and post-2019 (right) shapes.</figcaption> </figure>
<p>Typical changes involved standardising the shapes across cursive
forms, better distinctions between lower and uppercase forms, removal
of some ascenders to avoid diacritic collisions, and then addition of
some small ascenders to help distinguish joined forms. </p>
<p>There were also some significant shape changes, particularly to make
supplementary letters look more like those used for similar, standard
sounds, or to make letters easier to read.</p>
<p>Although there are not many Adlam Unicode fonts, and they will be
changed, legacy forms are likely to persist for some time alongside
the new forms. </p>
<p>The 2017 release of the Noto Sans Adlam font (still in use in early 2020)
contained a set of glyphs that sometimes matched one or other of the
shapes shown in <a class="figref">variant_shapes</a>, and sometimes
used completely different shapes from either. The Noto fonts were updated to the new shapes in September 2020.</p>
<p class="instructions"> Click
<button onclick="document.getElementById('notoShapes').style.display='inline'; return false;">here</button>
to also show in <a class="figref">variant_shapes</a> shapes produced by the Noto Sans Adlam font at the
start of 2020. Red underlines highlight some characters that don't
resemble either of the other charts.</p>
</section>





<section id="historical_justification">
<h3>Historical approaches to justification</h3>

<p>In the early stages of Adlam typography it was quite common to see full justification of printed text that was produced by stretching baselines, rather than by adjusting inter-word spaces. This was influenced by the use of keyboards based on Arabic code points. Handwritten documents, however, were not justified in this way.</p>

<p class="observation"><span class="leadin">Observation:</span> The Winden Jangen site has scans of a number of books which apply full justification. The method of justification appears to be elongation of the baseline, with no affect on the inter-word spacing. See <a class="figref">fig_justification</a>. In narrow columns this can produce some exaggerated stretching, as seen in <a class="figref">fig_justification_wide</a>. There are many passages in the samples available that apply this exaggerated stretching. <a href="https://www.windenjangen.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/OOGIRDE_MALAL_SAATAANDE_NDEN.18921945.pdf">Some content</a> also applies justification to the last line in a paragraph, which sometimes produces even wider elongations.</p>
