<section>
<p>This page gathers  basic information about the Hanifi Rohingya script and its use for  the  Rohingya language. It aims (generally) to provide an introduction to the orthography and typographic features, and (specifically) to advise how to write Hanifi Rohingya using Unicode.</p>
<p>Phonetic transcriptions on this page should be treated as an approximate guide, only. Many are more phonemic than phonetic, and there may be variations depending on the source of the transcription.</p>

<h2>Usage &amp; history</h2>

<p>Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics are used for a range of  Algonquin and Inuit orthographies indigenous to Canada, including Cree, Ojibwe, Inuktitut, and occasionally Blackfoot languages.</p>
<p>Inuktitut syllabics are  used in Canada by the Inuktitut-speaking Inuit of the territory of Nunavut and the Nunavik region in Quebec. The script is  used by governmental agencies and in business, education, and media.</p>
<p>In 1976, the Language Commission of the Inuit Cultural Institute made Inuktitut syllabics the co-official script for the Inuit languages, along with the Latin script and standardised both orthographies.</p>
<p><span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴌𐴟𐴇𐴥𐴝𐴚𐴒𐴙𐴝</span> <span class="trans">ɾuh²aŋgia</span> <span class="ipa">roʊˈɪndʒə</span> <span class="meaning">Rohingya</span></span>

<p>The 'Inuktitut language' comprises a number of similar dialects, which have divergeant vocabulary and pronunciation. The following lists dialects in Nunavit: Inuinnaqtun, Nattilingmiutut, Qamani’tuarmiutut, Paallirmiutut, Aivilingmiutut, North Qikiqtaaluk, Central Qikiqtaaluk, South Qikiqtaaluk (includes the capital, Iqaluit), and Sanikiluarmiutut. The orthography follows the sounds spoken, which leads to different spellings for the different dialects. Some dialects use only the Latin orthography.</p>
<p>The Canadian syllabic script was first created in 1840 by the British missionary James Evans for writing the Swampy Cree dialect. The individual symbols may represent different phonemes for each language.</p>
<p>The syllabic script was first adapted to represent Inuktitut around the middle of the 1800s, again by missionaries, and early print runs occurred in the 1870s.<span class="instructions"><a class="fnref more" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuktitut_syllabics#History">w</a></span></p>

<!--
myanmar
<p>The 20 consonant letters used for pure Burmese words are supplemented by 9 more which are used in Sanskrit words.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant stacking</mark> is used in multi-syllabic words (mostly derived from Pali) to indicate doubled  or homorganic consonant clusters. Subjoined forms are produced using a dedicated, invisible <span class="name">virama</span> character. Conjuncts do not span word boundaries.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>4 dedicated  combining marks</mark>
for the medial. Aspirated onset consonants are common: some have dedicated letters, others are indicated with a subjoined <span class="trans">h</span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use ordinary characters with a <mark>visible mark called <span class="name">asat</span></mark> to indicate that the inherent vowel is killed. There is also one dedicated final consonant (the <mark>anusvara</mark>). </p>




 thai
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high, mid, or low class</mark> related to tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p> 
<p><mark>No conjuncts</mark> are used for consonant clusters.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters and  <mark>syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds are all written with <mark>ordinary consonant letters</mark>. It can therefore be difficult to algorithmically detect syllable boundaries.</p>




 khmer
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high or low class</mark> related to pronunciation (there is no tone). Khmer has more vowel sounds than ways to write them, so the choice of consonant class indicates different sounds for the same written vowel. Other factors may also affect the  sound, such as stress, vowel harmony, and diacritics.</p>
<p><mark>Word-internal clusters</mark> are very common at the beginning of a word, but clusters also occur medially in multisyllable words, and occasionally at the end of a word (though the 2nd consonant at the word end is usually not pronounced). Clusters are indicated by <mark>stacked consonants</mark>. Subjoined forms are created using an invisible <span class="name">coeng</span> character. Stacks do not span word boundaries.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds (typically 8 consonants and characters) use <mark>ordinary code points</mark> without an inherent vowel. Because there are no spaces or other word dividers, it is difficult to detect boundaries algorithmically. Two word-final sounds (<span class="trans">m</span> and <span class="trans">h</span>) can be produced using combining marks.</p>



newtailue
<p>Each basic consonant is one of a pair, denoting either a <mark>high or low tonal register</mark> 
for the same phonetic sound.  This is very regular – each sound is represented by 2 consonant letters. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class and tone marks.<a class="fnref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Tai_Lue_alphabet">w</a></p>
<p><mark>No conjuncts</mark> are used for consonant clusters. Although, some clusters in Tai Tham are represented as single characters in New Tai Lü, in particular high tone variants such as <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦜ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦖ</span></span> (<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="nod">ᩉᩖ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="nod">ᩉ᩠ᨾ</span></span> in Tai Tham).</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>6 dedicated letters</mark> (for 3  pairs of consonants:<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦦᦨ ᦧᦩ ᦪᦫ</span></span>. There are no medial consonant letters. </p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use <mark>7 dedicated letters</mark>, which cover all needs.</p>

 taitham
<p>Each onset consonant is associated with a <mark>high, mid, or low class</mark> related to tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p> 
<p>Tai Tham has <mark>stacked consonants</mark>, but these do not necessarily indicate consonant clusters. The script is unusual in that any consonant in a stack can retain its inherent vowel, or be associated with a vowel-sign. The <span class="name">sakot</span>, which produces stacks, is never visible.</p>
<p>Stacks can  <mark>span word boundaries</mark>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>2 dedicated code points</mark> for the medial <span class="trans">l</span>, and a subjoined letter for medial <span class="trans">w</span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds can be written using 
<mark>6 special diacritics</mark>, but otherwise use <mark>ordinary letters</mark>, which may or may not be subjoined depending on the context.</p>


taiviet
<p>Each consonant is associated with a <mark>high or low class</mark> to indicate tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p>
<p>There are <mark>no conjuncts</mark> or subjoined consonants.</p>
<p>The only <mark>syllable-initial cluster</mark> involves labialisation, using <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="blt">ꪫ</span> <span class="transc">w</span></span>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-final</mark> consonant sounds use a subset of <mark>ordinary letters</mark>, but since there is no inherent vowel, it is still simple to detect syllable boundaries. Some syllable-final consonant sounds are built into 
<mark>vowel-consonant graphemes</mark>.</p>

 javanese




<p>The 20 consonant letters used for pure Javanese words are supplemented by 1o more which are used as <mark>honorifics</mark>, a little like capital letters, and 5 more used in Sanskrit words. <mark>Repertoire extensions</mark> for 8 non-native sounds are achieved by applying the <span class="name">rerekan</span> diacritic to  characters.</p>
<p>Consonant clusters are  represented by <mark>stacked consonants</mark> (many subjoined consonants have alternative shapes) or <mark>conjoined pairs</mark>. Occasionally, a visible <span class="name">pangkon</span> is used.</p>
<p>Stacked consonants and conjoined pairs <mark>span word boundaries</mark>.</p>
<p><mark>Syllable-initial</mark> clusters use <mark>3 dedicated combining marks</mark> for the second consonant.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds may be represented by <mark>4 dedicated combining marks.</mark> Otherwise, if nothing follows, they  are <mark>ordinary consonants followed by  a visible</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="jv">&#xA9C0;</span> [<a href="/scripts/javanese/block#charA9C0"><span class="uname">U+A9C0 JAVANESE PANGKON</span></a>]</span>.</p>


tamil
<p>There are fewer consonants than in other Indic scripts. Tamil has no aspirated consonant letters, and symbols are allocated on a phonemic basis, rather than phonetic. This means that <span lang="ta" >க</span>, for example, may be pronounced as the allophones <span class="ipa">k</span> <span class="ipa">ɡ</span> <span class="ipa">x</span> <span class="ipa">ɣ</span> or <span class="ipa">h</span>, according to where it appears relative to other sounds in a word, but its pronunciation doesn't change the word.</p>
<p>The 18 consonant letters used for pure Tamil words are supplemented by 6 more Grantha consonant signs which are used for English and Sanskrit loan words.  <mark>Repertoire extensions</mark> for 4 more non-native sounds are achieved by applying the <span class="name">āytam</span> diacritic to  characters.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant clusters</mark> are indicated using the visible <span class="name">puḷḷi</span> dot to indicate that no vowel follows a consonant. There are <mark>2 ligated forms</mark> which are exceptions from the rule: <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">க்ஷ</span> <span class="trans">k͓ʂ</span> <span class="ipa">kʃʌ</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">ஶ்ரீ</span> <span class="trans">ʃ͓ɾī</span> <span class="ipa">ʃri</span></span>.</p>
<p>Word-initial clusters do not appear in Tamil. Syllable-/word-final consonants  are just written using ordinary consonants with the <span class="name">puḷḷi</span> overhead, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="ta">தமிழ்</span> <span class="trans">tmiɻ͓</span> <span class="transc">(tamiḻ)</span> <span class="meaning">Tamil</span></span>.</p>


hindi
<p>The 33 consonant letters used for Hindi are supplemented by <mark>repertoire extensions</mark> for 8 more non-native sounds  by applying the <span class="name">nukta</span> diacritic to  characters.</p> 
<p><mark>Consonant clusters</mark> at any location are normally indicated using the <span class="name">virama</span> between consonants. This results in a large number of conjunct forms expressed using <mark>half-forms</mark>,  <mark>stacked consonants</mark>, and <mark>ligated glyphs</mark>. Occasionally, a visible <span class="name">virama</span> is used.</p>
<p>As part of a cluster, <mark>RA has  special forms</mark>. When initial in an orthographic syllable it appears as a hook at the top right of the  whole syllable. When non-initial it appears as one of 2 special marks applied to the other consonants.</p>
<p><mark>Word-final</mark> consonant sounds may be represented by <mark>2 dedicated combining marks</mark> (anusvara &amp; visarga), but are generally <mark>ordinary consonants</mark> that are not marked by a virama. Also, the inherent vowel of a penultimate consonant in a word of 3 syllables that ends in a non-inherent vowel is usually elided, and not marked as such.</p>






lao

<p>Unlike its close relative, Thai, the Lao orthography has an <mark>no inherent vowel</mark>, but still represents vowels using <mark>18 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 2 consonants. Only vowel-signs that appear above or below the consonant are <mark>combining marks</mark>; the others are <mark>ordinary characters</mark> that are typed in the order seen. Vowels are often written differently when they appear in a closed vs. open syllable.</p>
<p>There are <b class="newterm">no independent vowels</b>, and standalone vowel sounds are written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="lo">&#x0EAD;</span> [<a href="/scripts/lao/block#char0EAD"><span class="uname">U+0EAD LAO LETTER O</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section lists <mark>27 composite vowels</mark> (made from 12 vowel-signs, and 2 consonants).  Composite vowels can involve up to 4 glyphs, and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 3 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="lo">ເກັຍະ</span> <span class="transc">ēk̯äɲ̱a</span></span>.</p>
<p class="instructions">Dashes are used to  indicate whether the character represents a vowel sound in a closed   or an open syllable.</p>

<p class="instructions">Dashes are used to indicate the location of a consonant or consonant cluster. Prescript vowel-signs have been stored before the hyphen because of the limitations of the font, but in reality all vowel-signs should occur after the consonant they modify.</p>



myanmar

<p>The Burmese orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>8 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>1 prescript</mark>), and 3 consonants/diacritics.

It is mandatory for 2 of the consonant+vowel sequences  to be written using vocalics, rather than vowel-signs.</p>
<p><mark>Independent vowels</mark> are used  for standalone vowel sounds when there is a need to distinguish normal words from proper nouns or foreign words. The normal approach for standalone vowels is to <mark>apply vowel-signs to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="jv">&#xA9B2;</span> [<a href="/scripts/javanese/block#charA9B2"><span class="uname">U+A9B2 JAVANESE LETTER HA</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Only one <mark>composite vowel</mark> is used in modern Javanese orthography, although more exist when writing Sanskrit or Kawi in this script. There are no circumgraphs. The composite vowel used in modern Javanese involves only 2 vowel-signs, and places glyphs on either side of the base consonant(s), eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="jv">ꦏꦺꦴ</span> <span class="transc">ko</span></span>.</p>


tai viet
<p>The Tai Dam orthography has  <mark>no inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>15 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>5 prescripts</mark>), and 5 consonants.  Vowel signs are a mixture of <mark>ordinary spacing characters</mark>, and <mark>combining marks</mark>.</p>
<p>There are <mark>no independent vowels</mark>, and standalone vowel sounds use a <mark>vowel-sign attached to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="blt">&#xAAAE;</span> [<a href="/scripts/taiviet/block#charAAAE"><span class="uname">U+AAAE TAI VIET LETTER LOW O</span></a>]</span> or <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="blt">&#xAAAF;</span> [<a href="/scripts/taiviet/block#charAAAF"><span class="uname">U+AAAF TAI VIET LETTER HIGH</span></a>]</span>. </p>
<p>This section lists  only <mark>6 composite vowels</mark>, made from 6 vowel signs and 3 consonants. Composite vowels can involve up  to 3 glyphs, though usually only 2, and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on 2 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="blt">ꪵꪁꪫꪥ</span> <span class="transc">ɛkwy</span></span>.</p>


new tai lue
<p>The New Tai Lü orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>17 vowel-signs</mark>  (including <mark>4 prescripts</mark>). However, unlike many other SE Asian scripts, all vowel-signs are <mark>ordinary spacing characters</mark> (no combining marks), and are stored before or after the base character, as needed.</p>
<p> <span class="ednote">??? There are no independent vowels, and standalone vowel sounds are written using  vowel-signs applied to <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="shn">&#x1022;</span> [<a href="/scripts/myanmar/block#char1022"><span class="uname">U+1022 MYANMAR LETTER SHAN A</span></a>]</span>.</span></p>
<p>This section lists   <mark>9 composite vowels</mark> (made from 8 vowel signs). Composite vowels can involve up  to 3 glyphs, and  can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 2 sides (left and right only), eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="khb">ᦵᦂᦲᦰ</span> <span class="transc">e͕kiʔ</span></span>.</p>

 khmer

<p>The Khmer orthography has <mark>2 inherent vowels</mark>, and represents vowels using <mark>17 vowel-signs</mark> (including <mark>3 prescripts </mark> and    <mark>5 circumgraphs</mark>, 2 of which can decompose into  composite vowels), and 8 consonants or diacritics. All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character. </p>
<p>Khmer has more vowel sounds than ways to write them. Therefore, a written vowel can have different pronunciations, depending on the class of the base consonant. (There is no tone in Khmer, so classes are specially designed for vowel selection.)  Additional factors include whether this is an unstressed vowel, vowel harmony, and whether any of the special diacritics have been used to change the sound. For an in-depth treatment of pronunciation see <a href="#refs">Huffman</a> in the sources section.</p>
<p>There is an <mark>incomplete set of independent vowels</mark>, and standalone vowel sounds are typically written using  <mark>vowel-signs applied to</mark> <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="km">&#x17A2;</span> [<a href="/scripts/khmer/block#char17A2"><span class="uname">U+17A2 KHMER LETTER QA</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<p>This section lists <mark>15 composite vowels</mark> (made from 9 vowel signs, and 8 consonants/diacritics), not counting decompositions. Composite vowels can involve up to 3 glyphs, but  only surround the base consonant(s) on 2 sides, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">កោះ</span> <span class="transc">koh̽</span></span>.</p>
<p class="instructions">Dashes are used to  indicate whether the character represents a vowel sound in a closed   or an open syllable.</p>


tamil
<p>The Tamil orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents other vowels using <mark>11 vowel-signs</mark>, including <mark>3 prescripts</mark> and <mark>3 circumgraphs</mark>. All circumgraphs can be decomposed. All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character.</p>
<p>There are  <mark>12 independent vowels</mark>, one for each vowel sound, including the inherent vowel, and these are used to write all standalone vowel sounds.</p>
<p>The only  <mark>composite vowels</mark> are those created by decomposition of the circumgraphs, and involve 2 glyphs, one on each side of the base consonant(s).</p>


devanagari
<p>The Hindi orthography has an <mark>inherent vowel</mark>, and represents other vowels using <mark>9-11 vowel-signs</mark>, including <mark>1 prescript</mark> and no circumgraphs.  All vowel-signs are <mark>combining marks</mark>, and are stored after the base character.</p>
<p>There are  <mark class="newterm">10-12 independent vowels</mark>, one for each vowel sound, including the inherent vowel, and these are used to write all standalone vowel sounds.</p>
<p>There are no composite vowels.</p>
<p>Vowels may be nasalised, using the <span class="name">candrabindu</span> diacritic.</p>

<section id="basicVowels">
<h3>Basic vowels</h3>

<p> Rohingya uses the following vowel letters.</p>

<figure class="characterBox auto" data-cols="ipa,trans,transc">𐴞␣𐴟␣𐴠␣𐴡␣𐴀␣𐴝</figure>

<p>Rohingya vowel letters are all normal, spacing characters. With the exception of <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D00;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D00"><span class="uname">U+10D00 HANIFI ROHINGYA LETTER A</span></a>]</span>, they are never written alone, but have to follow a consonant.</p>
<p>A standalone vowel at the beginning of a word is always preceded by <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D00;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D00"><span class="uname">U+10D00 HANIFI ROHINGYA LETTER A</span></a>]</span>, which acts as a vowel carrier, eg. 
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴀𐴝𐴣𐴍𐴥𐴝𐴓𐴞</span>
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴀𐴦𐴟𐴘</span>
</p>
<p>Similarly, in a sequence of vowels inside a word, the non-initial vowels are preceded by the carrier, eg.
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴅𐴝𐴕𐴟𐴀𐴝𐴌𐴞</span>
</p>
<p>When <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D00;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D00"><span class="uname">U+10D00 HANIFI ROHINGYA LETTER A</span></a>]</span> occurs without a following vowel letter at the beginning or in the middle of a word, it represents the vowel <span class="ipa">ɔ</span>, eg. 
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴁𐴡𐴀𐴌 𐴉𐴝𐴃𐴝</span>
</p>
<p>Long vowels are indicated using  <a href="#tones">tone marks</a>.</p>
</section>







<section id="diphthongs">
<h3>Diphthongs</h3>

<p>Diphthongs beginning or ending in the glides <span class="ipa">j</span> or <span class="ipa">w</span> can be written using <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D19;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D19"><span class="uname">U+10D19 HANIFI ROHINGYA LETTER KINNA YA</span></a>]</span> and <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D17;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D17"><span class="uname">U+10D17 HANIFI ROHINGYA LETTER KINNA WA</span></a>]</span>, respectively. eg.

<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴁𐴝𐴘</span>
</p>
</section>








<section id="nasalisation">
<h3>Nasalisation</h3>

<p>Nasalised vowels are indicated by writing <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D23;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D23"><span class="uname">U+10D23 HANIFI ROHINGYA MARK NA KHONNA</span></a>]</span> after the vowel, eg. 
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴔𐴦𐴝𐴣</span>
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴈𐴝𐴣𐴓𐴞</span>
</p>
</section>








<section id="length">
<h3>Vowel length</h3>

<p>Vowel length is primarily affected by <a href="#tones">tone</a>.</p>
<p class="observation"><span class="leadin">Observation:</span> Also, it seems possible to repeat a vowel to lengthen a sound, eg. 
<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴈𐴡𐴀𐴡</span> <span class="trans">xoʔo</span> <span class="ipa">xo:</span></span
></p>
</section>








<section id="absence">
<h3>Consonants with no following vowel</h3>
<p>Consonant clusters are typically written just as a sequence of consonant letters, eg. 
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴑𐴡𐴔𐴂𐴘𐴟𐴄𐴝𐴌</span>
</p>
<p>At the end of a word, or when just the consonant is written alone, <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D22;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D22"><span class="uname">U+10D22 HANIFI ROHINGYA MARK SAKIN</span></a>]</span> is used after some consonants when there is no following vowel.</p>
<p>Consonants that typically take the <span class="name">sakin</span> include the following:</p>

<figure class="characterBox auto" data-cols="" data-notes="p,b,t,d,ʈ,g,f,s,ʃ,x,h,w,w,l,j,j">𐴂𐴢␣𐴁𐴢␣𐴃𐴢␣𐴊𐴢␣𐴄𐴢␣𐴒𐴢␣𐴉𐴢␣𐴏𐴢␣𐴐𐴢␣𐴈𐴢␣𐴇𐴢␣𐴖𐴢␣𐴗𐴢␣𐴓𐴢␣𐴙𐴢</figure>

<p>And those that don't:</p>

<figure class="characterBox auto" data-cols="ipa,trans,transc">𐴋␣𐴆␣𐴅␣𐴑␣𐴎␣𐴔␣𐴕␣𐴛␣𐴚␣𐴌␣𐴍</figure>

<p>However, these rules are not hard and fast. For example, <span class="ipa">m</span> may be written either way (see the example of 'turnip' below).</p>
<p>Examples: <span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴇𐴥𐴝𐴙𐴓𐴢</span>
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴐𐴥𐴝𐴓𐴒𐴡𐴔𐴢</span>
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴄𐴝𐴘𐴧𐴡𐴕</span>
<span class="eg" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴋𐴥𐴠𐴙𐴇𐴝𐴑</span>
</p>
</section>




 





<section id="tones">
<h3>Tones</h3>

<p>Rohingya has 3 tones. They indicate stress and vowel length, and are indicated in writing using dedicated combining characters, as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>short and high, <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D24;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D24"><span class="uname">U+10D24 HANIFI ROHINGYA SIGN HARBAHAY</span></a>]</span></li>
<li>long and falling, <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D25;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D25"><span class="uname">U+10D25 HANIFI ROHINGYA SIGN TAHALA</span></a>]</span></li>
<li>long and rising, <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D26;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D26"><span class="uname">U+10D26 HANIFI ROHINGYA SIGN TANA</span></a>]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>These  usually appear above the consonant in a syllable, however in some fonts the mark drifts to the left, so that it appears between the consonant and the vowel, eg.

<p class="observation"><span class="leadin">Observation:</span> In order to achieve the best positioning using the Noto Sans Hanifi Rohingya and the Rohingya Noories One fonts, it is necessary to type the tone mark after the consonant (rather than after the vowel, as suggested in Pandey's script proposal).</p>

<p class="info">When both <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D27;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D27"><span class="uname">U+10D27 HANIFI ROHINGYA SIGN TASSI</span></a>]</span> and a tone mark appear together, it is important to type in and store both in the correct order for display. The tassi is typed and stored first,<tt>u,684</tt> eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴔𐴡𐴙𐴅𐴧𐴤𐴙𐴠𐴊𐴠</span> <span class="trans">moiɟ&¹iede</span></span>

<!--section id="writing_styles">
<h3>Writing styles</h3>

<p>Urdu is normally written in a <span class="trans">nasta'liq</span> writing style. Key features include a sloping baseline for joined letters, and overall complex shaping and positioning for base letters and diacritics alike. There are also distinctive shapes for many glyphs and ligatures.</p>

<figure id="fig_baseline">
<p dir="rtl" lang="ur" class="large" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="ex">مستحق</span> &nbsp;•&nbsp; <span class="ex">شخص</span> &nbsp;•&nbsp; <span class="ex">کیفیت</span></p>
<figcaption>Sloping baselines and complex joining behaviours in Urdu nastaliq text.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is achieved in Unicode by applying the correct font – the underlying characters used are not different for nasta'liq vs. other styles.</p>

<p dir="rtl" lang="ur" class="medium" style="line-height: 2.5"> کوئی شخص محض حاکم کی مرضی پر اپنی قومیت سے محروم نہیں کیا جائے گا اور اس کو قومیت تبدیل کرنے کا حق دینے سے انکار نہ کیا جائے گا۔</p>

<section id="cursive">
<h3>Cursive text</h3>
<p>Hanifi Rohingya is  cursive, ie. letters in a word are joined up. </p>
<p>Nearly all letters join on both sides. <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D22;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D22"><span class="uname">U+10D22 HANIFI ROHINGYA MARK SAKIN</span></a>]</span> joins only to the right. And <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D00;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D00"><span class="uname">U+10D00 HANIFI ROHINGYA LETTER A</span></a>]</span> joins only to the left, which is very unusual. Fonts automatically produce the appropriate joining form for a code point, according to its visual context.</p>

<figure id="fig_cursive_triangle">
<img src="img/cursive_triangle.png" class="ex" alt="𐴃𐴞𐴕𐴑𐴟𐴙𐴕𐴧𐴝 𐴐𐴡𐴑𐴥𐴡𐴓𐴢">
<figcaption>Cursive connections in the word <span class="eg inline" lang="rhg" dir="rtl">𐴃𐴞𐴕𐴑𐴟𐴙𐴕𐴧𐴝 𐴐𐴡𐴑𐴥𐴡𐴓𐴢</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The cursive treatment  produces only minor changes to  glyph shapes in most cases, other than extensions to the baseline. <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="rhg" dir="rtl">&#x10D14;</span> [<a href="/scripts/rohg/block#char10D14"><span class="uname">U+10D14 HANIFI ROHINGYA LETTER MA</span></a>]</span> is an exception, with different final and medial/initial shapes (see <a class="figref">fig_joining_forms</a>). </p>
<p>There is a style of font which behaves slightly differently, and appears to be quite commonly used. <a class="figref">fig_cursive_triangle_noories</a> shows an example. Note how the <span class="trans">n</span> doesn't join to the right, and the <span class="trans">o</span> falls short of the <span class="trans">l</span>. The glyphs in this font don't have joining strokes to the right, and taper off and barely touch (if they do) to the left.</p>

<!--section id="gsub">
<h3>Context-based shaping</h3>

<p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>@ None of the characters require special shaping based on the visual context.</p>
<p>@ Many of the subjoined and post-fixed consonant forms have different shapes from the standard glyph for that character, for example <span class="name">na</span> <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬦ</span></span>  becomes &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">᭄ᬦ</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ In addition, many conjunct clusters combine characters with special  shapes, or subtly change parts of glyphs to join smoothly. Often the changes are significant, especially the medial consonants, ya, ra, wa and la. For example, see the sequence &lt;ba, adeg-adeg, ra, adeg-adeg, ya&gt; in <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬩ᭄ᬭ᭄ᬬᬕ᭄</span> <span class="trans">b͓r͓yg͓ (briag)</span> <span class="meaning">laughter</span></span>.</p>
<p>@ Combining vowel signs can also have different shapes depending on the context. For example, the vowel sign tedung typically ligates with the preceding consonant, eg. <span class="name">ha</span> is <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬳ</span></span>  but <span class="name">&lt;ha, tedong&gt;</span> is <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬳᬵ</span></span>  and <span class="name">subjoined ya</span> is &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" lang="tmp" style="font-family: 'Aksara Bali WF'!important;">᭄ᬬ</span></span>  but <span class="name">&lt;consonant, adeg-adeg, ya, tedong&gt;</span> can be rendered as &nbsp; <span class="charExample"><span class="ex" style="font-family: 'Aksara Bali WF'!important;" lang="tmp">᭄ᬬᬵ</span></span>.</p>
</section-->




<!--section id="gpos">
<h3>Context-based positioning</h3>

			<p class="prompts">tbd</p>
<p>@ Prescript vowels are visually ordered, and therefore do not need to be positioned by the font.</p>
<p>@ Vowel-signs, tones, and one consonant, on the other hand, are combining characters that need to be correctly positioned relative to the base character, and multiple marks can be combined with a single base character.</p>
<p>@ When a vowel and a final consonant sign both appear above a consonant, they are placed side by side, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="tmp">ᬱᬫ᭄ᬧᬶᬂ</span> <span class="trans">sm͓piŋ̇̽ (samping)</span> <span class="meaning">side</span></span>.</p>

<!--section id="hyphenation">
<h4>Hyphenation/word-breaking</h4>
<p>Because of the length of Tamil words, hyphenation is useful during layout, but it isn't easy to do because of the  complexity of Tamil words.</p>
<p>Hyphenation must take place at syllable boundaries. A hyphen is added at the end of the line when a word is hyphenated.</p>
<p>Prabhakar<a class="fnref" href="https://www.academia.edu/671796/Tamil_Hyphenator_P._David_Prabhakar">p</a> proposes rules that single characters should be avoided at line start/end, especially characters with nukta at line start, and a word with 5 characters including 3 consecutive consonants can't be split. He says that due to the fact that Tamil is highly inflexional, morphological or pattern based approaches are needed, rather than simple dictionary lookup.</p-->
