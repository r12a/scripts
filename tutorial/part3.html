    <p>Before starting this section it is important to draw attention to the difference between characters and glyphs.</p>
    <p>A <span class="newterm">character</span> is a semantic unit representing an indivisible unit of text in memory.</p>
    <p>A <span class="newterm">glyph</span> is the visual representation of a character or sequence of characters.</p>
    <p>The example on the slide shows several glyphs for a single ASCII character, and two glyphs for a single character Han character. This
      distinction between glyphs and characters will become very important in this section. For more information about the distinction between characters and glyphs, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr17/">Unicode Technical Report #17</a>.</p>
    <p>A <span class="newterm">font</span>, by the way, is a collection of glyphs. </p>

    <p>Arabic and Hebrew scripts usually do not represent short vowel sounds. The languages are so heavily pattern based that readers can

    <p>These short vowels are separate <span class="newterm">combining characters</span> in the text stream that are displayed in the same

    <p>When displaying combining characters, care has to be given to appropriate positioning. In the Thai example on the slide, the <em>same</em> character code is used to represent both of the tone mark glyphs that are circled. There are not two different characters based on the desired visual
      position. The font has to work out the best position for the glyph according to the run-time visual context. </p>

    <p>This slide provides another example of context-sensitive positioning of combining characters.</p>
    <p>The short vowel ‘i’ in Arabic is usually drawn below the base character. This is normally the only way of distinguishing it from the short
      vowel ‘a’, which is displayed above the base character.</p>
    <p>In this example, however, an additional <span class="newterm">shadda</span> diacritic is introduced. The shadda is used to lengthen the
      consonant it is attached to. In that context it is common (though not mandatory) for the ‘i’ vowel diacritic to appear <em>above</em> the base
      character, but <em>below</em> the shadda so you can still tell it apart from ‘a’.</p>
    <p>Note also that this example introduces the idea that you can have more than one combining character associated with a base character. </p>

    <div class="speaker-notes">
      <p>When it comes to implementing combining characters, an important question to ask is what order should be applied to them and the base
      character. Unless you have agreement on this, you can have serious problems when passing data between systems.</p>
      <p>The Unicode Standard requires that all combining characters <em>follow</em> the base consonant in a Unicode string. (So the example to the
      left on the slide is correct.) </p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="slide">
    <div class="slide-pic"><img src="images/coding-combining2.png" alt="slide" /></div>
    <div class="speaker-notes">
      <p>Each combining character has a combining class property expressed as a numeric value. Combining characters that appear in the same
        location relative to the base character when displayed will typically share the same combining class. For example acute, grave and circumflex accents
      all appear above the base character and all share the same combining class.</p>
      <p>Multiple combining characters do not have to be in any particular order unless they are in one of the <span class="newterm">Unicode
        normalisation forms</span>. The standard requires that sequences of combining characters should be treated as equivalent if they all have different
      combining classes.</p>
      <p>Unicode normalisation, however, applies a canonical ordering to multiple combining characters.</p>
      <p>If characters have the same combining class they are likely to interact typographically to produce different possible results, as in the
        case above. In this case the <span class="newterm">‘inside-out’ rule</span> is applied. This rule states that the proximity of the combining character in the text stream must
      match the visual proximity. </p>

    <h3><a href="normalization">Normalization</a></h3>
    <div class="slide-pic"><img src="images/normalization.png" alt="slide" /></div>
    <div class="speaker-notes">
      <p>To facilitate the process of string comparison for operations such as searching, sorting and comparison it is helpful to adopt a standard
        policy with regard to precomposed versus decomposed variants of a character sequence, and the order in which multiple combining characters appear.
        This can be achieved by applying an appropriate <span class="newterm">normalization form</span>. The Unicode Standard provides a normalization form
        called <span class="newterm">NFD</span> that represents all character sequences in maximally decomposed form. In addition to decomposition, NFD applies a standard order to
        multiple composing characters attached to a base character. As an alternative, the Unicode Standard offers NFC. <span class="newterm">NFC</span> is achieved by applying NFD to
      the text, then re-composing characters for which precomposed forms exist in version 3.0 of the standard.</p>
      <p>Note that there are actually some precomposed forms in the Unicode character set that are <em>not</em> generated by NFC, for reasons we
        will not go into here. In addition, where there is no precomposed form, a character sequence is left decomposed, but canonical ordering is still
      applied to all combining characters.</p>
      <!--<p>The World Wide Web Consortium is recommending that all Web content be stored in NFC, to assist in efficient and correct processing.</p>-->
      <p>The Unicode Standard also offers two more normalization forms, <span class="newterm">NFKD</span> and <span class="newterm">NFKC</span>, where K stands for ‘kompatibility’. These forms are provided
        because the Unicode character set includes many characters merely to provide round-trip compatibility with other character sets. Such characters
        represent such things as glyph variants, shaped forms, alternative compositions, and so on, but can be represented by other ‘canonical’ versions of
        the character or characters already in Unicode. Ideally, such compatibility variants should not be used. The NFKD and NFKC normalization forms
        replace them with more appropriate characters or character sequences. (This, of course, can cause a problem if you intend to convert data back into
      its original encoding, because you lose the original information.) </p>

    <p>On previous slides we mentioned the ‘run-time’ context. This is quite important. If you type in the Arabic letter HEH shown at the top of the
      slide it will initially be in an independent glyph form. If you press exactly the same key on the keyboard and insert exactly the same character
      alongside it in memory, however, the original letter HEH will be expected to join with the second HEH. The shape of the first HEH will therefore
      change to ‘initial’, and the second HEH will be in ‘final’ shape. Type another HEH and the second will become ‘medial’, and so on.</p>
    <p>In this way Arabic text is constantly changing as you type. The editing application also has to adapt these glyphs as you do things such

  <div class="slide-pic"><img src="images/conjuncts.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>When two Indic consonants appear together without any intervening vowel sound they may form a <span class="newterm">conjunct</span>, ie.
      the consonant cluster is rendered as a composite shape. This composite shape may show a vertical or horizontal mixture of the base shapes. In some
      cases the original constituents of a conjunct may not be recognizable.</p>
    <p>One approach that is very common is the use of a <span class="newterm">half-form</span> to represent the initial consonant in the cluster.
      An example of this is shown on the bottom line of the slide.</p>
    <p>It is important to bear in mind, once again, that this is all glyph magic. The individual consonants are all still represented using the
      regular code points in memory, it is only the visual appearance that changes. There are no special code points for half-form glyphs. The alternate glyph appropriate for the context is simply applied at display time according to the rendering rules of the script. </p>

    <p>In  fact, there is a vital ingredient to a conjunct form that we have not yet discussed. It has various script-specific names, but here we will use the generic term '<span
			 class="newterm">virama'</span>. The virama is often also called ‘vowel killer’.</p>
    <p>If you simply put two consonants side by side in Unicode, as in the top line on the slide, you will get two separate consonants displayed
      (with the assumption on the part of the reader that there is an inherent vowel between them).</p>
    <p>It is only when you put a virama character between them that they combine to form a conjunct. So the conjunct glyph shown middle right
      actually represents three underlying characters.</p>
    <p>The number of conjunct forms can vary from font to font. Some fonts will be capable of rendering more than others. So what happens if the
      font you are using doesn’t have a conjunct glyph for the combination you want to create? In such a case the virama is shown visually as a combining mark – see the last line on the slide. (In fact, in modern Tamil this is the
      default approach.) </p>

      more advanced behavior.</p>
   <p>Half-form glyphs in Indic scripts  express the absence of a following vowel. This is a systematic and functional use of special shaping forms. The variation in shape carries a meaning to the reader.</p>

There is only one asat character, and the shape used to display it is picked from the font's repertoire of glyphs at run time according to rules encoded in the font.

      <p>The example text from the Thai sample shown on this slide illustrates the same effect in Thai. This word is pronounced very much like
      ‘program’, and the vowel sign at the far left is actually pronounced after the third character (ie. it is the ‘o’ sound after ‘pr’).</p>
      <p>We have already seen, however, that vowel signs are not necessarily combining in Thai, so no reordering is actually needed in this case.
      The characters displayed are actually stored in the same order in memory. </p>

      <p>This slide shows some additional examples of reordering during display.</p>
      <p>The top example shows a single Tamil code point which is a combining character that places glyphs on <em>both</em> sides of the base consonant when
      displayed.</p>
      <p>The bottom example shows the Devanagari <span class="newterm">repha</span> in a consonant cluster. The RA code that appears at the
      beginning of the cluster in memory is rendered as a diacritic above the vowel sign that completes the syllabic cluster. </p>

      <p><span class="newterm">Ligatures</span> are very common. In font terms, a ligature is a single glyph that represents more than one underlying
      character.</p>
      <p>The example shown here is of a mandatory ligature in Arabic. A LAM character followed by an ALEPH character must always be displayed as a single lam-alef shape. Note carefully, however, that you should continue to use two characters in memory to represent this sequence: a LAM and an ALEPH.</p>
      <p>In  fact, while some fonts represent lam-alif using a single ligature glyph, others combine smaller partial glyphs to achieve the same effect. We will use the term 'ligature' here is a very loose sense to mean a combination of characters that are displayed as what, to the reader, looks like a single shape.</p>

      <p>We have seen how Arabic glyphs join up with each other when juxtaposed. Unicode provides some special characters, invisible to the naked

      <p>The <span class="newterm">zero-width non-joiner character</span> (U+200C) can be inserted between the three characters LHM to create the
      effect on the second line. Here the three characters are not separated by spaces, but the glyphs no longer join.</p>
      <p>The <span class="newterm">zero-width joiner character</span> (U+200D), on the other hand, has the opposite effect. The three characters on
        the third line have spaces between them, but the joiner character is used to produce the joining forms of the glyphs. This behaviour is occasionally
      needed for correctly rendering Arabic text. </p>

      <p>What a user thinks of as a "character"—a basic unit of a writing system for a language—may not be just a single Unicode code point. Instead, that basic unit may be made up of multiple Unicode code points. This called a user-perceived character. The a-acute shown on the slide it is typically thought of as a single character by users, yet it may actually be represented by two Unicode code points. It is still expected to behave in many editing or typographic situations as a single unit.</p>

      <blockquote>&quot;Grapheme cluster boundaries are important for collation, regular expressions, UI interactions (such as mouse selection, arrow key movement, backspacing), segmentation for vertical text, identification of boundaries for first-letter styling, and counting “character” positions within text. Word boundaries, line boundaries, and sentence boundaries should not occur within a grapheme cluster: in other words, a grapheme cluster should be an atomic unit with respect to the process of determining these other boundaries.&quot; </blockquote>

      <p>The definition of grapheme cluster was expanded in 2008 to cover some additional combinations.

      <p>The current definition  of grapheme cluster incorporates accented characters and other combining characters, including spacing combining characters. It also includes some other characters.  Significantly, it doesn't include non-combining  characters used for Thai vowel signs. </p>

      <p>The top line of the slide shows a Tamil word, split into 3 grapheme clusters: (1) a base character with a combining vowel-sign to its left, (2) a ligated base character and vowel-sign, and (3) a base character with a combining character above.</p>
      <p>The Thai word on the second line is split into 6 grapheme clusters: (1) and (2) are a base consonant followed by a vowel-sign, but the vowel-sign is a non-combining character, so these are both separate graphemes; (3) is a consonant with an inherent vowel; (4) is a base consonant followed by two combining characters, one of which is composed of two parts, the second of which extends the cluster horizontally. Items (5) and (6) are a single consonant+inherent vowel, and a consonant with combining vowel-sign above, respectively.</p>

      <p>There are still some combinations of glyphs that users may consider a single unit, but which are not currently covered by the concept of grapheme cluster.  Some Indic languages other than Tamil have  groupings of glyphs that interact in a complicated way to create a single unit.  In the word on the slide, the first syllable includes a consonant + virama + consonant + vowel sign. It is clear that this is a single typographic unit, not only because the first consonant uses the half glyph common to such conjuncts, but because the vowel-sign appears to the left of the whole group, and extends over to the rightmost part.</p>
<p>However, although this is one grapheme (ie. user-perceived unit), the Unicode grapheme cluster algorithm treats this as two grapheme clusters, where the first (the brown one) is embedded inside the second, visually. This is because the algorithm doesn't combine the characters following the virama.</p>
<p>UAX #29 describes the notion of tailored grapheme clusters for this.  The problem is that such a combination of characters is not always rendered in way that looks like a single character – sometimes a virama may be used, rather than a ligature. So tailorings for conjuncts may need to be script-, language-, font-, or context-specific to be useful. </p>
