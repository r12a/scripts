    <p>It is not easy to determine what is meant by ‘word’. Typically people initially think of items in a sentence separated by spaces or
      certain types of punctuation. In languages such as German and Turkish, however, such runs of text can include a number of concepts run together.</p>
    <p>This and the next few slides will consider in a very basic way the relevance of ‘words’ to some of the scripts in discussion here. For
      want of better terminology, we will use the term word in a general sense to mean a unit of meaning smaller than a phrase or sentence. We will also
      consider the highlighting behavior of Windows when you double-click in the middle of some text.</p>
    <p>The example on this slide is Greek. Greek words are delimited by spaces. Typically double-clicking in Windows will highlight the text
      between spaces (and, depending on your settings, some space too). </p>

    <p>Chinese does not use spaces for word separation. Most ideographs have word-like meanings, although it is common for a sequence of
      characters to have a composite meaning derived from the individual parts.</p>
    <p>Windows uses a dictionary lookup approach for double-click selection. The example on this slide was produced by double-clicking one of the
      two characters highlighted. </p>

    <p>Japanese also makes no use of spaces for word separation. The apparent spacing in the example above is simply the lack of ink in the
      mono-spaced character cells.</p>
    <p>The examples on this slide shows the effect of double-clicking in Windows in a number of different contexts. The first two show how
      Windows uses a dictionary-based approach to locate word boundaries within a run of kanji and hiragana text respectively. The third example is
      katakana text. The fourth example (at the bottom) highlights both the kanji and the hiragana that constitute an inflected word. </p>

  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>In this section we will look at line breaking. Justification often occurs at the same time, but we will examine it separately to keep the
      explanations simple.</p>
    <p>Line breaking is typically word-based or character-based. Character-based line breaking usually involves the application of special
      character-specific rules. </p>

    <p>You can see how each script wraps by going to the the <a href="/scripts/summaries/wrapping">word wrap test page</a> and changing the width of the browser window. It is
      impressive to see how, if all scripts are displayed together, each line wraps according to its own rules.</p>
    <p>English, Greek, Hindi, and Russian text wraps whole words onto the next line.</p>
    <p>Arabic and Hebrew do the same, but the text wraps to the right. Wrapping of embedded Latin text produces a special effect that will be
      described later.</p>
    <p>Chinese, Japanese and Korean all wrap on a character by character basis, subject to the rules that will be described later. Korean is
      sometimes wrapped on a word basis, but it is more common these days to wrap on a character basis, despite the fact that Korean words are separated by
      spaces.</p>
    <p>Thai is wrapped on a word basis, but a dictionary or other mechanism is needed to detect word boundaries, since they are not separated by
      spaces. </p>

    <p>This slide shows the rules for character-based line breaking that apply by default for Japanese in Office XP, minus the full vs. half

  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>The question arises, if Japanese and Chinese are typically grid-like in layout, what happens when a character such as a comma would by
      default appear at the beginning of a line as in the first example above.</p>
    <p>Typically there are two possible approaches. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>the preceding character is pulled down to the next line</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the comma is left protruding into the margin.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>These alternatives are illustrated in the lower level panels on the slide.</p>
    <p>In fact there is another alternative if justification is available, but we will leave that for the next section. </p>

    <p>This slide shows the result of breaking a line in the middle of some Latin text in Arabic and Hebrew. The result is not immediately
      obvious for people unaccustomed to these scripts, as the order of words appears to be swapped.</p>
    <p>This is because, although you can read in either direction horizontally, you are only expected to read down from one line to the next. </p>
    <p>It is important to note that the order of characters in memory has NOT changed. This is purely rendering magic. </p>

  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>Latin and Cyrillic scripts allow hyphenation of words at the end of a line in order to achieve a better fit.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that hyphenation rules differ from language to language within the same script. The slide shows hyphenation that
      is not permitted according to German orthographic rules. </p>

  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>Unicode provides a soft-hyphen character (U+00AD   SOFT HYPHEN) that can be used to control hyphenation. If the application displaying the text knows how to handle it, the hyphen will only be displayed if a word doesn't fit at the end of a line.</p>
    <p>This is another kind of character that should be ignored when comparing strings, counting characters, ordering text, etc.</p>
    <p>The slide shows some German text where the last word contains two soft hyphens. As the text size is increased the space available for the last word at the end of the line decreases, and the word is broken at the nearest hyphenation point, and the hyphen displayed.</p>

    <p>This slide lists possible approaches to justification. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>no justification,</p>

      <li>
        <p>adjusting the space between words,</p>

      <li>
        <p>adjusting the baseline connection between joined glyphs.</p>

    <p>On this slide, justification has used inter-word spacing only. Note how the result is less than perfect, with large inter-word spaces on

  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>In this third slide, both inter-word and inter-character spacing have been applied to the same text, and produce a much better result.</p>
    <p>Note that justification does not only involve expansion. In fact it is common for a justification algorithm to attempt to reduce
      inter-word or inter-character spacing first, up to a certain limit, before expanding them.</p>
    <p>Note also that expanding inter-character spaces in German will indicate to a German reader that the words are emphasized, not justified.
      So stretching inter-character spaces is uncommon in German text. </p>

  <div class="slide-pic"><img src="images/justification5.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>This slide illustrates how justification can be used to remove the blank space at the end of the first line of text that we saw in the
      section about line breaking. The justification involves equally expanding the space between all characters on the first line.</p>
    <p>Typically in character-based justification, rules are applied to different types of character in successive waves. For example, the
      algorithm may attempt to reduce the spacing around punctuation first, and only when more adjustment is needed turn to adjusting the spacing between
      ideographs.</p>
    <p>In the section on line breaking we saw how punctuation can be left protruding into the right margin. Justification can also be used to
      draw this punctuation into the main body of text by reducing the inter-character spacing across the line. </p>

    <h3><a href="#j-arabic">Justification in Arabic</a></h3>
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/justification6.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/justification7.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>These two slides illustrate justification in Arabic based on extension of the baseline.</p>
    <p>Note  that this kind of baseline extension is also used for emphasising text in Arabic, for example in headings. </p>
    <p>More sophisticated rendering algorithms produce this effect without adding additional characters to memory, and by stretching the baseline typographically. This can be referred to as <span class="newterm">kashida</span>. Better quality applications also use additional techniques to stretch the text, such as replacing certain character glyphs with wider variants. They may also stretch interword spaces, and even the small spaces inside words where characters don't join to the left.</p>
    <p>The very unsophisticated approach
      shown on the slide was copied from a newspaper where they had simply added baseline extension characters called <span class="newterm">tatweel</span> (U+0640) to the text.</p>
    <p>Whatever approach is used to elongate the words, there are rules about how much elongation is appropriate, and where it should occur. These rules also vary from type style to type style. For example, the rules for a naskh font will differ from those for a nasta'liq font. In fact, the ruq'a font style doesn't allow stretching at all.</p>

  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/justification8.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>Another common approach to justification in Arabic script is to reduce the width of words, in order to produce a better fit. One way to achieve this is to use ligatures. Note how the (same) word in the example on the slide is much shorter where ligatures are used.</p>

  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/linebreak7.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>Other scripts have different rules about how to do justification. The example on this slide shows how Tibetan may sometimes fill the remainder of the line with small <em>tsek</em> characters (syllable separators) – although, actually, the rules are a little more complicated than that, and some lines do not get filled with tseks while others do.</p>

<div id="tamil_justification" class="slide">
  <div class="slide-pic"> <img src="images/linebreak8.png" alt="slide" /></div>
  <div class="speaker-notes">
    <p>This final example shows some Tamil text. Tamil words tend to be long, and in a narrow space, such as a newspaper column, it may not be possible to fit more than one word on a line. It is still desirable, however, to maintain a straight line down the left and right side of the column. To achieve this, Tamil may stretch the word to fill the line. Note how this spacing is achieved by spacing <em>glyphs</em> rather than code points: certain vowel-signs become separated from their base consonant, and a circumgraph around a base character involves two equal amounts of spacing.</p>
